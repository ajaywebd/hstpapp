      <h1 class="acne-page-title">Exercise-Induced Asthma</h1>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Most kids and teens with asthma have symptoms when they exercise. But
        some people (including those without asthma) experience asthma symptoms
        only during or after exercise, known as exercise-induced asthma (EIA) or
        exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB).
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">Signs & Symptoms of EIA</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Wheezing, tightness, or pain in the chest</li>
        <li>Coughing and lasting shortness of breath</li>
        <li>Getting winded or tired easily during or after exercise</li>
        <li>Coughing after outdoor activity</li>
        <li>Difficulty running for more than a few minutes without stopping</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Symptoms usually begin 5–10 minutes after starting to exercise and may
        peak 5–10 minutes after stopping the activity. Recovery can take an hour
        or longer.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">Causes</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        EIA is primarily caused by inhaling cold, dry air during exercise. Rapid
        breathing through the mouth bypasses the natural warming and humidifying
        effects of the nose, causing the airways to narrow. This is called
        bronchoconstriction. Despite these challenges, regular exercise can help
        reduce asthma symptoms over time.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">How Is EIA Diagnosed?</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Diagnosis typically includes a medical history, a physical exam, and a
        breathing test after exercise. The test may involve running on a
        treadmill, exercising outdoors, or performing an activity that has
        triggered symptoms in the past.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">How Is EIA Treated?</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Pretreatment:</strong> Taking quick-relief medicine (rescue or
          fast-acting medicine) before exercising to prevent airway narrowing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Long-Term Control Medicine:</strong> If pretreatment isn’t
          sufficient, doctors may prescribe maintenance medicine to reduce
          airway inflammation over time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Adjustments:</strong> Consult a doctor if symptoms persist
          during exercise, as medication dosages may need adjustments.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">Which Activities Are OK for Kids With EIA?</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Exercise is beneficial for everyone, including kids with EIA. Safe
        activities often include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Walking, jogging, or hiking</li>
        <li>Golf</li>
        <li>Baseball</li>
        <li>Football</li>
        <li>Gymnastics</li>
        <li>Shorter track and field events</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        While endurance sports like long-distance running or cold-weather sports
        can be challenging, kids with proper training and medication can often
        participate in any sport they enjoy.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">Tips for Kids With Exercise-Induced Asthma</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>If symptoms start, stop exercising until they subside.</li>
        <li>
          Warm up with 5–10 minutes of light activity and stretching before
          exercise.
        </li>
        <li>Take quick-relief medicine just before starting exercise.</li>
        <li>
          Breathe through the nose during exercise to warm and humidify the air.
        </li>
        <li>
          Take brief rests and use quick-relief medicine if symptoms start.
        </li>
        <li>Cool down after exercising to help the lungs adjust gradually.</li>
        <li>Exercise indoors if air pollution or pollen levels are high.</li>
        <li>
          Wear a ski mask or scarf over the mouth and nose during cold weather.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Ensure quick-relief medicine is always accessible, and regularly check
        inhalers to avoid carrying an empty one.
