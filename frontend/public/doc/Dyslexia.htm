      <h1 class="acne-page-title">Dyslexia</h1>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Dyslexia is a learning disorder that involves difficulty reading due to
        problems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to
        letters and words (decoding). Also called a reading disability, it
        affects areas of the brain that process language.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        People with dyslexia have normal intelligence and usually have normal
        vision. Most children with dyslexia can succeed in school with tutoring
        or a specialized education program. Emotional support also plays an
        important role.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Though there’s no cure for dyslexia, early assessment and intervention
        result in the best outcome. Sometimes dyslexia goes undiagnosed for
        years and isn’t recognized until adulthood, but it’s never too late to
        seek help.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Symptoms</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Signs of dyslexia can be difficult to recognize before your child enters
        school, but some early clues may indicate a problem. Severity varies,
        but the condition often becomes apparent as a child starts learning to
        read.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">Before School</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Late talking</li>

      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Causes</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Researchers haven’t pinpointed exactly what causes dyslexia, but they
        know that genes and brain differences play a role. Some possible causes
        include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Genes and Heredity:</strong> Dyslexia often runs in families.
          About 40% of siblings and 49% of parents of kids with dyslexia have
          similar issues. Scientists have identified several genes linked to
          difficulties with reading and language processing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Brain Anatomy and Activity:</strong> Brain imaging studies
          show differences in areas related to reading skills, such as
          recognizing sounds in words and understanding written text. However,
          brain activity changes with proper tutoring, thanks to
          neuroplasticity.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Risk Factors</h2>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>A family history of dyslexia or other learning disabilities</li>
        <li>Premature birth or low birth weight</li>
        <li>
          Exposure during pregnancy to nicotine, drugs, alcohol, or infections
          that may alter brain development
        </li>
        <li>Individual differences in brain areas responsible for reading</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Diagnosis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        There’s no single test that can diagnose dyslexia. A number of factors
        are considered, such as:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Your child's development, educational issues, and medical history: The
          doctor will likely ask questions about conditions that run in the
          family, including whether any family members have a learning
          disability.
        </li>
        <li>
          Home life: The doctor may ask for a description of your family life
          and any potential issues at home.
        </li>
        <li>
          Questionnaires: The doctor may ask your child, family members, or
          teachers to answer questions and take tests to identify reading and
          language abilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Vision, hearing, and brain (neurological) tests: These tests help rule
          out other disorders that could be causing or contributing to reading
          difficulties.
        </li>
        <li>
          Psychological testing: Questions may be asked to assess whether social
          problems, anxiety, or depression could be limiting your child’s
          abilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Testing reading and other academic skills: Your child may take a set
          of educational tests and have their reading skills analyzed by a
          reading expert.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Treatment</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        There’s no known way to correct the brain abnormalities that cause
        dyslexia — dyslexia is a lifelong problem. However, early detection and
        appropriate treatment can improve success.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">Educational Techniques</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Dyslexia is treated using specific educational approaches and
        techniques. Early intervention is important, and psychological testing
        can help develop a suitable teaching program.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Teachers may use methods involving hearing, vision, and touch to improve
        reading skills. Helping a child engage multiple senses — such as tracing
        letters while listening to sounds — can aid in processing information.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">Treatment focuses on helping your child:</p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Learn to recognize and use the smallest sounds that make up words
          (phonemes)
        </li>
        <li>
          Understand how letters and letter combinations represent these sounds
          (phonics)
        </li>
        <li>Comprehend what they are reading</li>
        <li>Read aloud to build accuracy, speed, and expression (fluency)</li>
        <li>Build a vocabulary of recognized and understood words</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Tutoring sessions with a reading specialist can be helpful. If a child
        has severe reading difficulties, tutoring may need to be more frequent,
        with slower progress.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">Individual Education Plan (IEP)</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        In the U.S., schools are legally obligated to take steps to help
        children diagnosed with dyslexia. A written plan, called an
        Individualized Education Plan (IEP), outlines your child's needs and how
        the school will support them.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">Early Treatment</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Children who receive extra help in kindergarten or first grade often
        improve enough to succeed in school. Those who don’t get help until
        later may struggle academically and may never fully catch up.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">What Parents Can Do</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Address the problem early: If you suspect dyslexia, talk to your
          child's doctor. Early intervention can improve success.
        </li>
        <li>
          Read aloud to your child: Begin reading to your child from a young
          age, even at 6 months old. Listening to recorded books can help as
          well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Work with your child’s school: Collaborate with teachers to create a
          plan that helps your child succeed. You are your child's best
          advocate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Encourage reading time: Set aside time for reading practice. Encourage
          your child to read regularly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Set an example for reading: Read something of your own while your
          child reads to show that reading can be enjoyable.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Complications</h2>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Trouble learning: A child with dyslexia may struggle in most subjects
          due to reading difficulties.
        </li>
        <li>
          Social problems: Left untreated, dyslexia can lead to low self-esteem,
          anxiety, or withdrawal from social circles.
        </li>
        <li>
          Problems as adults: The inability to read and comprehend can limit a
          child’s potential, leading to long-term social and economic
          consequences.
        </li>
        <li>
          Increased risk of ADHD: Children with dyslexia are at a higher risk of
          having attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, which can complicate
          treatment.
        </li>
