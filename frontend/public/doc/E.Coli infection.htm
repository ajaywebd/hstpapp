      <h1>E. Coli Infection</h1>

      <p>
        E. coli (Escherichia coli) is a type of bacteria that normally live in
        the intestines of people and animals. However, some types of E. coli,
        particularly E. coli O157, can cause intestinal infection. E. coli O157
        and other strains that cause intestinal sickness are called Shiga
        toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) after the toxin they produce.
      </p>

      <p>
        Symptoms of intestinal infection include diarrhea, abdominal pain, and
        fever. More severe cases can lead to bloody diarrhea, dehydration, or
        even kidney failure. People with weakened immune systems, pregnant
        women, young children, and older adults are at increased risk for
        developing these complications.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most intestinal infections are caused by contaminated food or water.
        Proper food preparation and good hygiene can greatly decrease your
        chances of developing an intestinal infection.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most cases of intestinal E. coli infection can be treated at home.
        Symptoms generally resolve within a few days to a week.
      </p>

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>

      <p>
        Symptoms of intestinal infection generally begin between 1 and 10 days
        after being infected with E. coli. This is known as the incubation
        period. Once symptoms appear, they usually last around 5 to 10 days.
        Symptoms may include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Abdominal cramping</li>
        <li>Sudden, severe watery diarrhea that may change to bloody stools</li>
        <li>Gas</li>
        <li>Loss of appetite or nausea</li>
        <li>Vomiting (uncommon)</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Fever</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Symptoms can last anywhere from a few days to more than a week.</p>

      <h3>Severe Symptoms</h3>

      <p>Symptoms of a severe E. coli infection may include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Bloody urine</li>
        <li>Decreased urine output</li>
        <li>Pale skin</li>
        <li>Bruising</li>
        <li>Dehydration</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Call your doctor if you experience any of these severe symptoms.</p>

      <h2>Causes of E. coli Infection</h2>

      <p>
        People and animals normally have some E. coli in their intestines, but
        some strains cause infection. The bacteria can enter your body through
        various means.
      </p>

      <h3>Improper Food Handling</h3>

      <p>
        Whether food is prepared at home, in a restaurant, or in a grocery
        store, unsafe handling and preparation can cause contamination. Common
        causes of food poisoning include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Failing to wash hands completely before preparing or eating food
        </li>
        <li>
          Using unclean utensils, cutting boards, or serving dishes, causing
          cross-contamination
        </li>
        <li>
          Consuming dairy products or food containing mayonnaise that have been
          left out too long
        </li>
        <li>
          Consuming foods that haven’t been stored at the right temperature
        </li>
        <li>
          Consuming foods that aren’t cooked to the right temperature or
          duration, especially meats and poultry
        </li>
        <li>Consuming raw seafood products</li>
        <li>Drinking unpasteurized milk</li>
        <li>Consuming raw produce that hasn’t been properly washed</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Other Causes</h3>

      <p>
        <b>Food Processing</b>: During the slaughtering process, poultry and
        meat products can acquire bacteria from the animals' intestines.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Contaminated Water</b>: Poor sanitation can cause water to contain
        bacteria from human or animal waste. You can get the infection from
        drinking contaminated water or from swimming in it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Person to Person</b>: E. coli can spread when an infected person
        doesn’t wash their hands after having a bowel movement. The bacteria are
        then spread when that person touches someone or something else, like
        food.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Animals</b>: People who work with animals, especially cows, goats,
        and sheep, are at increased risk for infection. Regular handwashing is
        essential in these environments.
      </p>

      <h2>Risk Factors</h2>

      <p>
        While anyone can experience an E. coli infection, certain factors
        increase the risk, including:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Age</b>: Older adults and young children are more likely to
          experience serious complications.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Weakened Immune System</b>: Those with weakened immune systems are
          more susceptible.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Season</b>: Infections are more likely to occur from June to
          September.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Low Stomach Acid Levels</b>: Medications that lower stomach acid
          can increase your risk.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Certain Foods</b>: Unpasteurized milk or juices and undercooked
          meat are risk factors.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When to See a Doctor</h2>

      <p>
        E. coli infection can lead to dehydration and serious complications,
        such as kidney failure and sometimes death. Seek medical attention if:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Diarrhea persists for more than four days (or two days for
          infants/children).
        </li>
        <li>There is a fever with diarrhea.</li>
        <li>Abdominal pain doesn't improve after a bowel movement.</li>
        <li>There is blood or pus in the stool.</li>
        <li>You have trouble keeping liquids down.</li>
        <li>Vomiting persists for more than 12 hours.</li>
        <li>You've recently traveled abroad and are experiencing symptoms.</li>
        <li>You show symptoms of dehydration.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>

      <p>
        In most cases, home care is sufficient. Drink plenty of water, rest, and
        monitor for severe symptoms. In cases of bloody diarrhea or fever,
        consult your doctor before taking over-the-counter medications.
      </p>

      <h2>Prevention</h2>

      <p>To prevent E. coli infection, follow these safe food practices:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Avoid cross-contamination by using clean utensils and surfaces.</li>
        <li>Keep raw meats separate from other foods.</li>
        <li>
          Defrost meat in the refrigerator or microwave, not on the counter.
        </li>
        <li>Refrigerate leftovers immediately.</li>
        <li>Drink only pasteurized milk products.</li>
        <li>Avoid preparing food if you have diarrhea.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The U.S. Department of Agriculture provides guidelines for cooking meat
        to ensure bacteria are killed. Use a meat thermometer to check that meat
        is cooked to these temperatures:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Poultry</b>: 165°F (74°C)</li>
        <li><b>Ground meat, eggs</b>: 160°F (71°C)</li>
        <li>
          <b>Steaks, pork chops, roasts, fish, shellfish</b>: 145°F (63°C)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        One of the simplest ways to prevent E. coli infection is to regularly
        wash your hands, especially before handling or eating food and after
        interacting with animals or using the bathroom.
