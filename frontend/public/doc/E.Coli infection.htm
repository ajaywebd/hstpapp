      <h1 class="acne-page-title">E. Coli Infection</h1>

      <p class="acne-main-text">
        E. coli (Escherichia coli Bacteremia) is a type of bacteria that
        normally live in the intestines of people and animals. However, some
        types of E. coli, particularly E. coli O157, can cause intestinal
        infection. E. coli O157 and other strains that cause intestinal sickness
        are called Shiga toxin–producing E. coli (STEC) after the toxin that
        they produce.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Symptoms of intestinal infection include diarrhea, abdominal pain, and
        fever. More severe cases can lead to bloody diarrhea, dehydration, or
        even kidney failure. People with weakened immune systems, pregnant
        women, young children, and older adults are at increased risk for
        developing these complications.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Most intestinal infections are caused by contaminated food or water.
        Proper food preparation and good hygiene can greatly decrease your
        chances of developing an intestinal infection. Most cases of intestinal
        E. coli infection can be treated at home, and symptoms generally resolve
        within a few days to a week.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Symptoms</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Symptoms of intestinal infection generally begin between 1 and 10 days
        after infection, known as the incubation period. Symptoms typically last
        around 5 to 10 days and include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Abdominal cramping</li>
        <li>Sudden, severe watery diarrhea that may change to bloody stools</li>
        <li>Gas</li>
        <li>Loss of appetite or nausea</li>
        <li>Vomiting (uncommon)</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Fever</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Severe E. coli infections may include additional symptoms such as:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Bloody urine</li>
        <li>Decreased urine output</li>
        <li>Pale skin</li>
        <li>Bruising</li>
        <li>Dehydration</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        According to the CDC, 5 to 10 percent of infections can develop into
        hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a condition that damages red blood
        cells and may lead to kidney failure. HUS typically begins 5 to 10 days
        after the onset of diarrhea.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Causes of E. Coli Infection</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        E. coli infections are caused by specific bacterial strains entering the
        body through various means, including:
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">Improper Food Handling</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Failing to wash hands completely before preparing or eating food
        </li>
        <li>Using unclean utensils, cutting boards, or serving dishes</li>
        <li>
          Consuming dairy products or food containing mayonnaise left out too
          long
        </li>
        <li>Improper food storage temperatures</li>
        <li>Undercooked meats or poultry</li>
        <li>Raw seafood products</li>
        <li>Drinking unpasteurized milk</li>
        <li>Consuming improperly washed raw produce</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">Food Processing</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        During slaughter, poultry and meat products can become contaminated with
        bacteria from animal intestines.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">Contaminated Water</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Poor sanitation can result in water containing bacteria from human or
        animal waste. Infection can occur from drinking or swimming in
        contaminated water.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">Person-to-Person Transmission</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        E. coli can spread when an infected person doesn’t wash their hands
        properly after a bowel movement, contaminating food or surfaces. Nursing
        homes, schools, and childcare facilities are especially vulnerable.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">Animals</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        People working with animals like cows, goats, or sheep have a higher
        risk of infection. Regular handwashing is essential after contact with
        animals or their environment.
      </p>
      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Risk Factors</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        While anyone can experience an E. coli infection, some people are more
        at risk than others. Some risk factors include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Age: Older adults and young children are more likely to experience
          serious complications from E. coli.
        </li>
        <li>
          A Weakened Immune System: People with weakened immune systems are more
          susceptible to E. coli infections.
        </li>
        <li>
          Season: E. coli infections are more likely to occur during the summer
          months, June to September, for unknown reasons.
        </li>
        <li>
          Low Stomach Acid Levels: Medications used to decrease stomach acid
          levels can increase your risk of E. coli infection.
        </li>
        <li>
          Certain Foods: Drinking unpasteurized milk or juices and eating
          undercooked meat can increase your risk of E. coli.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">When to See a Doctor</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Intestinal infection can lead to dehydration and serious complications,
        such as kidney failure and sometimes death, if it's not treated. You
        should see your doctor if:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          You have diarrhea that isn’t getting better after four days, or two
          days for an infant or child.
        </li>
        <li>You have a fever with diarrhea.</li>
        <li>Abdominal pain doesn’t get better after a bowel movement.</li>
        <li>There is pus or blood in your stool.</li>
        <li>You have trouble keeping liquids down.</li>
        <li>
          Vomiting has continued for more than 12 hours. For a baby under 3
          months old, contact your pediatrician as soon as symptoms begin.
        </li>
        <li>
          You have symptoms of intestinal infection and have recently traveled
          to a foreign country.
        </li>
        <li>
          You have symptoms of dehydration, such as a lack of urine, extreme
          thirst, or dizziness.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        A doctor can confirm an E. coli infection with a simple stool sample.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Treatment</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        In most cases, home care is all that’s required to treat an E. coli
        infection. Drink plenty of water, get lots of rest, and keep an eye out
        for more severe symptoms that require a call to your doctor.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        If you have bloody diarrhea or fever, check with your doctor before
        taking over-the-counter antidiarrheal medications. You should always
        check with your pediatrician before giving medications to infants or
        children.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        If dehydration is a concern, your doctor may order hospitalization and
        intravenous fluids. Most people show improvement within five to seven
        days after the onset of an infection and make a full recovery.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Prevention</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Practicing safe food behaviors can decrease your chances of developing
        an intestinal infection due to E. coli. These include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Washing fruits and vegetables thoroughly</li>
        <li>
          Avoiding cross-contamination by using clean utensils, pans, and
          serving platters
        </li>
        <li>
          Keeping raw meats away from other foods and away from other clean
          items
        </li>
        <li>Not defrosting meat on the counter</li>
        <li>Always defrosting meat in the refrigerator or microwave</li>
        <li>Refrigerating leftovers immediately</li>
        <li>Drinking only pasteurized milk products (avoiding raw milk)</li>
        <li>Not preparing food if you have diarrhea</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Make sure that all meat is cooked properly. The U.S. Department of
        Agriculture provides guidelines for cooking meat and poultry to proper
        temperatures to ensure all bacteria are killed. Use a meat thermometer
        to check that the meat is cooked to these temperatures:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Poultry: 165°F (74°C)</li>
        <li>Ground meat, eggs: 160°F (71°C)</li>
        <li>Steaks, pork chops, roasts, fish, shellfish: 145°F (63°C)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        One of the easiest things you can do to prevent an E. coli infection is
        to regularly wash your hands. Wash your hands before handling, serving,
        or eating food and especially after touching animals, working in animal
        environments, or using the bathroom. Practicing good hygiene and
        following food safety guidelines can go a long way in decreasing your
        risk of infection.
