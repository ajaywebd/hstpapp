      <h1 class="acne-page-title">Celiac Disease</h1>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Celiac disease is a digestive problem that affects the small intestine.
        It prevents the body from absorbing nutrients from food. People with
        celiac disease are sensitive to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye,
        barley, and sometimes in small amounts in mixed oats. In children with
        celiac disease, consuming gluten damages finger-like projections called
        villi in the lining of the small intestine.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Celiac disease is a lifelong condition, but it is manageable through
        permanent dietary modifications. Anyone with celiac disease must adhere
        to a gluten-free diet. While this may seem challenging at
        first—especially for children—many nutritious and tasty foods fit into
        this diet, including fruits, vegetables, eggs, meat, poultry, and even
        soft drinks and ice cream.

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Quick Facts on Celiac Disease</h2>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Approximately 40,000 Americans have been diagnosed with celiac
          disease.
        </li>
        <li>
          Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease, meaning it causes the immune
          system to attack the body.
        </li>
        <li>
          Symptoms of celiac disease can appear at any age after gluten is
          introduced into the diet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Patients with celiac disease must follow a lifelong gluten-free diet.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Risk Factors for Children</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Children are at higher risk for celiac disease if they have:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Type 1 diabetes</li>
        <li>Autoimmune thyroid disease</li>
        <li>Dermatitis herpetiformis</li>
        <li>Down syndrome</li>
        <li>Turner syndrome</li>
        <li>Williams syndrome</li>
        <li>A relative with celiac disease</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Does My Child Have Celiac Disease?</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        A child can begin to show symptoms of celiac disease anytime after
        eating foods with gluten. Symptoms vary from child to child, and some
        children may show no symptoms at all. By the time symptoms develop, some
        damage to the small intestine may have already occurred. If you suspect
        your child has celiac disease, contact your pediatrician immediately.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">What Causes Celiac Disease?</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Celiac disease is a genetic condition that runs in families. It is
        possible to have celiac disease without showing symptoms. Certain
        factors may trigger the onset of symptoms, such as:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Too much stress</li>
        <li>Pregnancy or childbirth</li>
        <li>Surgery</li>
        <li>Physical injury</li>
        <li>Infection</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Symptoms of Celiac Disease</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">Symptoms of celiac disease may include:</p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Chronic diarrhea or constipation</li>
        <li>Vomiting</li>
        <li>Bloating and gas</li>
        <li>Irritability</li>
        <li>Decreased appetite and/or poor weight gain</li>
        <li>Growth and pubertal delay</li>
        <li>Iron deficiency anemia</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Fractures or thin bones</li>
        <li>Decreased muscle mass in the limbs</li>
        <li>Damage to tooth enamel or failure of enamel formation</li>
        <li>A chronic itchy rash called dermatitis herpetiformis</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Diagnosing Celiac Disease</h1>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Blood Work:</strong> If your pediatrician suspects celiac
          disease, they will likely start with blood tests. Two common tests,
          the anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTG) and the
          anti-endomysial antibody (EMA), are highly accurate and reliable in
          determining the likelihood of celiac disease.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Biopsy:</strong> To confirm the diagnosis, a tissue sample
          from the small intestine must be examined for changes to the villi.
          The sample is collected through an endoscopy with biopsy. This
          procedure involves using a flexible tube-like instrument inserted
          through the mouth, past the stomach, and into the small intestine to
          obtain tissue samples.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Treatment and Management</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        If your child is diagnosed with celiac disease, there is good news: it's
        a highly manageable condition. Once gluten is removed from their diet,
        symptoms often improve within one to two weeks. Within six to twelve
        months, the intestine's lining will heal, and your child's growth and
        bone strength will normalize. However, celiac disease is not "cured,"
        and lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet is necessary.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Foods containing wheat, barley, rye, or their derivatives, such as
        bread, cereal, cakes, pizza, and pasta, must be avoided. While the diet
        may initially seem restrictive, there is a wide and growing variety of
        gluten-free foods available. Consulting a dietitian and joining a
        support group can help ease the transition.
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Follow-up regularly with your child’s healthcare team to ensure proper
          health and development.
        </li>
        <li>
          Key elements for managing celiac disease include:
          <ul>
            <li>Consultation with a skilled dietitian</li>
            <li>Education about the disease</li>
            <li>Lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet</li>
            <li>Identification and treatment of nutritional deficiencies</li>
            <li>Access to an advocacy group</li>
            <li>Continuous long-term follow-up by a multidisciplinary team</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Living with Celiac Disease</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Celiac disease is a chronic condition that requires significant
        lifestyle adjustments. The dietary restrictions can have social and
        emotional impacts on both the patient and their family. Fear of
        cross-contamination or restricted food options may lead to social
        isolation or avoidance of events involving meals.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        If coping becomes challenging, consult your dietitian or doctor for
        advice. They can provide support, suggest celiac disease support groups,
        or refer you to counseling to address anxiety or emotional stress
        related to the condition.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">What is Gluten?</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. It acts as the
        “glue” that holds products together and also serves as a leavening
        agent. In people with celiac disease, gluten is toxic and damages the
        small intestine, leading to decreased nutrient absorption and potential
        health issues such as:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Iron deficiency anemia</li>
        <li>Decreased bone density</li>
        <li>Unintentional weight loss</li>
        <li>Folate and vitamin B12 deficiency</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Where is Gluten Found?</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Gluten is found in grains like wheat, rye, barley, and their
        derivatives. These are commonly used in bread, cereals, pasta, pizza,
        cakes, pies, and cookies, as well as in processed foods.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">What About Oats?</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Studies suggest that oats may not be harmful to most people with celiac
        disease. However, cross-contamination with wheat during milling and
        processing is a concern. Consult your physician or dietitian before
        adding oats to your child's diet.
