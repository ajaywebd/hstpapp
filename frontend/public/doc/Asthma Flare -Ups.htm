      <h1 class="acne-page-title">Asthma Flare-Ups</h1>
      <p class="acne-main-text acne-left-img">
        Keeping asthma under control helps kids avoid breathing problems. But
        sometimes, asthma symptoms get worse, making kids wheeze, cough, or be
        short of breath. This is known as an asthma flare-up (also called an
        asthma attack, episode, or exacerbation).
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">If the flare-up is severe, a child might:</p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Struggle to breathe or have rapid breathing even when sitting still
        </li>
        <li>
          Be unable to speak more than a few words at a time without pausing
        </li>
        <li>
          Have retractions (sucking in of muscles in the neck and chest) while
          breathing in
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">What Happens in an Asthma Flare-Up?</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        In the lungs, airways let air in and out. When someone has asthma, these
        airways (also called bronchial tubes and bronchioles) might be slightly
        inflamed or swollen, even when the person seems to be breathing fine.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">During a flare-up:</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          The inflammation gets worse. Sticky mucus clogs the airways and their
          walls get more swollen.
        </li>
        <li>
          The muscles around the airways get tight, further narrowing them (this
          is called bronchoconstriction).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        These problems leave very little room in the airways for air to flow
        through — think of a straw that's being pinched.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Causes</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        People with asthma have airways that are overly sensitive to some things
        (called triggers). Being around triggers can bring on asthma symptoms.
        Common triggers include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Tobacco smoke</li>
        <li>Cold air</li>
        <li>Exercise</li>
        <li>Infections, such as colds</li>
        <li>Animal dander</li>
        <li>Dust mites</li>
        <li>Mold</li>
        <li>Cockroaches</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Many people with asthma also have allergies. For them, allergens — the
        things that cause the allergic symptoms — can also cause asthma
        flare-ups.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        If not treated, a flare-up can last for several hours or even days.
        Quick-relief medicines (also called rescue medicines or fast-acting
        medicines) often stop the symptoms pretty quickly. A person should feel
        better once the flare-up ends, although this can take several days.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Signs</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Asthma flare-ups can vary in strength and length. They can happen
        without warning, causing sudden coughing, shortness of breath, and
        wheezing.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Flare-ups can also build over time, especially when asthma isn't well
        controlled. Knowing early warning signs is crucial for immediate
        treatment:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Coughing</li>
        <li>Throat clearing</li>
        <li>Rapid or irregular breathing</li>
        <li>Being very tired</li>
        <li>Trouble doing everyday activities</li>
        <li>Restless sleep or coughing that prevents sleep</li>
        <li>Mild chest tightness or wheezing</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Because flare-ups can be life-threatening, they demand attention.
        Quick-relief medicine, a doctor visit, or even hospitalization may be
        needed. Following your child's asthma action plan helps guide what to do
        during a flare-up.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Prevention</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">To help prevent flare-ups:</p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Ensure your child always has quick-relief medicine available.</li>
        <li>Teach your child how to avoid asthma triggers.</li>
        <li>
          Make sure your child takes the long-term control medicine (also called
          controller medicine or maintenance medicine) as directed by the
          doctor. Even when feeling well, it's important not to skip it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure your child gets a yearly flu vaccine, and washes hands well
          and often to avoid germs that can lead to colds and other illnesses.
        </li>
        <li>Work with the doctor to create an effective asthma action plan.</li>
      </ul>
