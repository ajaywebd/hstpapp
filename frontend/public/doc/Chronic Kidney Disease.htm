        Chronic kidney disease (CKD) occurs when a child's kidneys do not
        function as they should, leading to a buildup of waste in the body. The
        Pediatric Chronic Kidney Disease Clinic at C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital
        focuses on slowing or stopping kidney damage with comprehensive care and
        access to advanced treatments.

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Symptoms</h2>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>More frequent urination, especially at night</li>
        <li>Feeling tired and having less energy</li>
        <li>Trouble sleeping</li>
        <li>Nausea</li>
        <li>Headaches</li>
        <li>Weight loss and/or loss of appetite</li>
        <li>
          Swelling in feet, ankles, or around the eyes due to fluid buildup
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Causes</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>In infants and children:</strong> Birth defects, congenital
          abnormalities, and hereditary diseases like polycystic kidney disease.
          Frequent untreated urinary tract infections (UTIs) may also lead to
          CKD.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>In teenagers:</strong> Conditions like glomerulonephritis,
          nephrotic syndrome, or systemic diseases like lupus are common causes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>In adults:</strong> Diabetes and high blood pressure are
          primary causes. While rare in children, obesity and type 2 diabetes
          beginning in childhood may contribute to CKD later in life.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Diagnosis</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Urinalysis:</strong> Checks for protein in the urine,
          indicating kidney damage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Blood tests:</strong> Assess kidney function, chemical levels,
          and red blood cell count.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Imaging:</strong> Ultrasounds and X-rays provide a visual
          assessment of kidney damage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Kidney biopsy:</strong> Examines tissue samples to determine
          the cause and extent of kidney damage.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Treatment</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Treatment starts with dietary changes and medications, including
        vitamins, calcium, and blood pressure pills. Injectable treatments like
        erythropoietin help manage anemia and boost energy, while human growth
        hormone injections promote normal growth. For advanced stages, options
        include dialysis or kidney transplant.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Treatment</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Treatment begins with dietary changes and medicines. Children may need
        several medicines, including vitamins, calcium, bicarbonate, and blood
        pressure pills, which can make medication management challenging. Tools
        like medicine clocks or setting alarms can help children remember to
        take their medicines on time.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Injectable medicines, such as erythropoetin, are available for treating
        anemia and growth failure in children with chronic kidney disease. These
        injections can improve energy levels and support normal growth. Human
        growth hormone injections are also effective in promoting better growth
        for many children with CKD.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Dialysis</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        For children with end-stage kidney disease, dialysis is often necessary
        until a donor kidney becomes available. The two main types of dialysis
        are:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Hemodialysis:</strong> Blood is filtered outside the body
          using a machine. This procedure typically takes several hours and is
          done three or more times a week, either at a dialysis center or at
          home in some cases.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Peritoneal dialysis:</strong> Uses the body's peritoneal
          membrane to filter blood. Two forms are available:
          <ul class="acne-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD):</strong>
              Performed at night using a cycler machine, often requiring
              parental assistance, suitable for younger children.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD):</strong>
              Performed during the day without a machine, typically managed by
              older children or teens.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Peritoneal dialysis generally allows for fewer dietary restrictions,
        offering more flexibility and promoting better growth in children
        compared to hemodialysis.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Helping Your Child</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Kids with chronic kidney disease often need dietary changes to ensure
        they get enough calories and nutrients. Extra carbohydrates and fats can
        increase calorie intake. However, intake of water, salt, potassium, and
        dairy may need to be limited due to their effects on kidney function.
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Phosphorus restriction:</strong> High phosphorus levels can
          cause calcium deposits in the body and leach calcium from bones,
          increasing the risk of fractures. Reducing dairy and other
          protein-rich foods can ease kidney workload but should be balanced to
          support growth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fluid intake monitoring:</strong> As kidney function declines,
          fluid intake may need to be limited. Smaller drink portions and
          alternatives like slushy beverages or ice cubes can help manage fluid
          intake.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Sodium</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Children with kidney disease, especially those with high blood pressure,
        may need to restrict sodium intake. Sodium is found in table salt and
        many processed foods. Be cautious with salt substitutes, as they often
        contain potassium, which can be problematic for kids with kidney
        failure. Even "natural salts" like Himalayan salts are high in sodium
        chloride.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Always read food labels and consult your doctor or dietitian to
        determine the sodium content in various foods. A nephrologist can
        recommend a diet that meets your child's calorie and nutrient needs
        while minimizing kidney damage and avoiding complications.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Exercise</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Exercise helps kids sweat, eliminating excess fluids and flushing out
        toxins through the skin. Limit screen time from TVs and video games, and
        encourage physical activity. Activities like walking and strength
        training can strengthen bones and stimulate muscles and nerves, easing
        issues like "restless leg syndrome" associated with kidney disease.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Emotions</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Supporting emotional health is crucial for kids with chronic kidney
        disease. Encourage them to express their feelings and connect with
        well-adjusted young adults who managed kidney disease during childhood.
        Nephrologists or organizations like the National Kidney Foundation can
        help you find support groups.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Participation in school and extracurricular activities can boost
        self-esteem. During hemodialysis treatments, positive activities like
        homework, reading, or art projects can help kids pass the time
        constructively.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Looking Ahead</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        As children grow older, they can take more responsibility for their
        care. School-age kids should know their medications and how to take
        them. Teens transitioning to adulthood can help schedule appointments
        and should be encouraged to discuss their condition with their health
        care team independently.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Helping children talk about their condition with teachers, coaches, and
        friends is a significant step. Teens often struggle with not wanting to
        stand out, so fostering independence while identifying limitations is
        important.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Long-term medication use, such as prednisone, can have side effects,
        including weight gain, mood changes, sleep disturbances, cataracts, and
        weakened bones. These side effects can also affect growth and pubertal
        development. For teens, visible side effects like acne can impact body
        image. It is important to address these concerns alongside kidney
        disease management.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Beyond managing chronic illness, kids face the challenges of growing up.
        Treat them as children first by setting consistent behavioral
        expectations. Standards may need temporary adjustments during difficult
        times, but it’s essential to reestablish them once health improves. Open
        communication within the family and with healthcare professionals is
        vital for maintaining physical and emotional well-being.
