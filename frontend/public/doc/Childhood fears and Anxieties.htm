        Understanding Childhood Fears and Anxieties
      </h1>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        From time to time, every child experiences fear. As youngsters explore
        the world around them, having new experiences and confronting new
        challenges, anxieties are almost an unavoidable part of growing up.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Fears Are Common</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        According to one study, 43% of children between ages 6 and 12 had many
        fears and concerns. A fear of darkness, particularly being left alone in
        the dark, is one of the most common fears in this age group. So is a
        fear of animals, such as large barking dogs. Some children are afraid of
        fires, high places, or thunderstorms. Others, conscious of news reports
        on TV and in newspapers, are concerned about burglars, kidnappers, or
        nuclear war. Serious illness or death in the family may make them
        anxious about the health of those around them.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        In middle childhood, fears wax and wane. Most are mild, but even when
        they intensify, they generally subside on their own after a while.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">About Phobias</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Sometimes fears can become so extreme, persistent, and focused that they
        develop into phobias. Phobias – strong and irrational fears – can
        significantly interfere with a child's daily activities. For instance, a
        6-year-old's phobia about dogs might make him so panicky that he refuses
        to go outdoors, fearing the presence of a dog. A 10-year-old might
        become terrified by news reports and insist on sleeping with their
        parents.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Phobias can also involve severe shyness, separation anxiety, or
        preoccupation with death. These anxieties might cause physical symptoms
        like headaches or stomach pains, eventually leading to withdrawal or
        depression.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Treating Fears & Phobias</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Fortunately, most phobias are treatable and are not a sign of serious
        mental illness. If anxieties persist and interfere with daily life,
        professional help from a psychiatrist or psychologist can be beneficial.
        A common treatment method is desensitization, where the child is
        gradually exposed to the source of fear in small, nonthreatening steps
        under a therapist's supervision.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Psychotherapy, breathing exercises, and relaxation techniques can also
        help children become less fearful. In some cases, medication like
        antidepressants may be recommended, but only as part of a comprehensive
        treatment plan.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        As part of the treatment plan for phobias, many therapists suggest
        exposing your child to the source of her anxiety in small,
        nonthreatening doses. Under a therapist's guidance, a child who is
        afraid of dogs might begin by talking about this fear and by looking at
        photographs or a videotape of dogs. Next, she might observe a live dog
        from behind the safety of a window. Then, with a parent or a therapist
        at her side, she might spend a few minutes in the same room with a
        friendly, gentle puppy. Eventually, she will find herself able to pet
        the dog, then expose herself to situations with larger, unfamiliar dogs.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        This gradual process is called desensitization, meaning that your child
        will become a little less sensitive to the source of her fear each time
        she confronts it. Ultimately, the child will no longer feel the need to
        avoid the situation that has been the basis of her phobia. While this
        process sounds like common sense and easy to carry out, it should be
        done only under the supervision of a professional.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">What Parents Can Do</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Talk with your child about their anxieties and be sympathetic. Explain
          that fears are common and they can overcome them with support.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not belittle or ridicule your child's fears, especially in front of
          peers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Encourage your child to gradually confront their fears but avoid
          forcing them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reassure and support your child without reinforcing their fears. Point
          out protective measures already in place and involve them in
          identifying additional steps.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Sensitive and straightforward parenting can often resolve or manage
        childhood fears. If realistic reassurances fail, the child's fear may be
        a phobia that requires professional intervention.
