      <h1>Dwarfism</h1>

      <p>
        Dwarfism is short stature resulting from a genetic or medical condition.
        It is generally defined as an adult height of 4 feet 10 inches (147
        centimeters) or less. The average adult height among people with
        dwarfism is 4 feet (122 cm).
      </p>

      <p>
        Many different medical conditions cause dwarfism. These disorders are
        divided into two broad categories:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Disproportionate Dwarfism</b>: Body size is disproportionate when
          some parts of the body are smaller, and others are of average or
          above-average size. Disorders causing disproportionate dwarfism
          inhibit bone development.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Proportionate Dwarfism</b>: A body is proportionately small if all
          parts are equally small and proportioned like an average-sized body.
          Medical conditions present at birth or appearing in early childhood
          limit overall growth and development.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Some people prefer the term "short stature" instead of "dwarf" or
        "dwarfism." It's essential to respect the preference of someone with
        this disorder. Short stature disorders do not include familial short
        stature, which is considered a normal variation with typical bone
        development.
      </p>

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>

      <p>
        Signs and symptoms, aside from short stature, vary significantly across
        the spectrum of disorders.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Disproportionate Dwarfism</b>: Most people with dwarfism have
          disorders causing disproportionately short stature. Usually, this
          means a person has an average-size trunk with very short limbs. The
          head may also be disproportionately large compared to the body.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Almost all people with disproportionate dwarfism have normal
        intellectual capacities. Rare exceptions may occur due to secondary
        factors, such as hydrocephalus (excess fluid around the brain).
      </p>

      <p>
        The most common cause of dwarfism is a disorder called
        <b>achondroplasia</b>, which results in the following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>An average-size trunk</li>
        <li>
          Short arms and legs, particularly short upper arms and upper legs
        </li>
        <li>
          Short fingers, often with a wide separation between the middle and
          ring fingers
        </li>
        <li>Limited mobility at the elbows</li>
        <li>
          A disproportionately large head with a prominent forehead and a
          flattened nose bridge
        </li>
        <li>Progressive development of bowed legs</li>
        <li>Progressive development of a swayed lower back</li>
        <li>An adult height of about 4 feet (122 cm)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Another cause of disproportionate dwarfism is a rare disorder called
        <b>spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC)</b>. Signs may include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>A very short trunk</li>
        <li>A short neck</li>
        <li>Shortened arms and legs</li>
        <li>Average-size hands and feet</li>
        <li>A broad, rounded chest</li>
        <li>Slightly flattened cheekbones</li>
        <li>Opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate)</li>
        <li>Hip deformities causing thighbones to turn inward</li>
        <li>A foot twisted or out of shape</li>
        <li>Instability of the neck bones</li>
        <li>Progressive hunching of the upper spine</li>
        <li>Progressive development of a swayed lower back</li>
        <li>Vision and hearing problems</li>
        <li>Arthritis and joint movement issues</li>
        <li>
          An adult height ranging from 3 feet (91 cm) to just over 4 feet (122
          cm)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <b>Proportionate Dwarfism</b> results from medical conditions present at
        birth or appearing in early childhood that limit overall growth. In this
        case, the head, trunk, and limbs are all small but proportionate. These
        disorders may affect the development of one or more body systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Growth hormone deficiency</b> is a common cause of proportionate
        dwarfism. It occurs when the pituitary gland does not produce enough
        growth hormone. Signs include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Height below the third percentile on standard pediatric growth charts
        </li>
        <li>Slower growth rate than expected for age</li>
        <li>Delayed or absent sexual development during the teen years</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <b>When to see a doctor</b>: Signs of disproportionate dwarfism are
        often present at birth or early infancy. Proportionate dwarfism may not
        be apparent immediately. See your child's doctor if you have concerns
        about your child's growth or development.
      </p>

      <h2>Causes</h2>

      <p>
        Most dwarfism-related conditions are genetic disorders. Many cases
        result from a random genetic mutation in the father's sperm or the
        mother's egg. However, the causes of some conditions are unknown.
        Examples of causes include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Achondroplasia</b>: About 80% of people with achondroplasia are
          born to parents of average height. A person with achondroplasia may
          pass a mutated or normal copy of the gene to their children.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Turner Syndrome</b>: This condition affects girls and women,
          resulting from a missing or partially missing X chromosome.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Growth Hormone Deficiency</b>: This may result from a genetic
          mutation or injury, but for most people with the condition, the cause
          is unknown.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Other Causes</b>: These include other genetic disorders, hormone
          deficiencies, or poor nutrition. Sometimes the cause is unknown.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Complications</h2>

      <p>
        Complications of dwarfism-related disorders can vary, but some common
        issues include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Disproportionate Dwarfism</b>: Common problems include delays in
          motor skill development, frequent ear infections, bowing of the legs,
          sleep apnea, pressure on the spinal cord, hydrocephalus, crowded
          teeth, and progressive hunching or swaying of the back.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Proportionate Dwarfism</b>: These issues often result in poorly
          developed organs, such as heart problems, which may significantly
          affect health.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Pregnancy</b>: Women with disproportionate dwarfism may develop
          respiratory problems during pregnancy, and a C-section is often
          necessary.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Public Perceptions</h2>

      <p>
        People with dwarfism prefer not to be labeled by their condition,
        although some refer to themselves as dwarfs or little people. The term
        "midget" is considered offensive. Misconceptions about dwarfism can
        affect self-esteem and opportunities for success. Children with dwarfism
        may feel isolated and are vulnerable to teasing.
      </p>

      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>

      <p>
        Diagnosis involves measurements of height, weight, and head
        circumference, appearance, imaging technology, genetic tests, family
        history, and hormone tests.
      </p>

      <h2>Health Care Team</h2>

      <p>
        A variety of specialists may be involved in diagnosis and treatment,
        including endocrinologists, ENT specialists, orthopedists, geneticists,
        cardiologists, ophthalmologists, psychologists, neurologists,
        orthodontists, developmental therapists, and occupational therapists.
      </p>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>

      <p>
        Treatment for dwarfism usually addresses complications rather than
        increasing stature. This may include surgical treatments, limb
        lengthening, hormone therapy, and ongoing healthcare.
      </p>

      <h2>Lifestyle and Home Remedies</h2>

      <p>
        At-home care may include using proper infant car seats, supporting the
        child's head and neck, monitoring for complications, encouraging good
        posture, maintaining a healthy diet, and promoting healthy activities
        like swimming or cycling while avoiding collision sports.
      </p>

      <h2>Coping and Support</h2>

      <p>
        Steps to help children cope with dwarfism include seeking help from
        organizations like Little People of America, modifying the home, using
        adaptive tools, educating school personnel, and addressing teasing.
