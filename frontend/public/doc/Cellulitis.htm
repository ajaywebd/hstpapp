      <h1 class="acne-page-title">Cellulitis</h1>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Cellulitis is a common bacterial skin infection that typically appears
        as a red, swollen area that feels hot and tender to the touch. The
        redness and swelling can spread quickly, and the condition is usually
        painful. While cellulitis commonly affects the skin on the lower legs,
        it can occur anywhere on the body or face. It may involve the surface of
        the skin, underlying tissues, lymph nodes, and even the bloodstream.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        If untreated, cellulitis can spread and become life-threatening.
        Immediate medical attention is necessary if you experience symptoms of
        cellulitis.
      </p>

      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Cellulitis occurs when certain bacteria, commonly Staphylococcus or
        Streptococcus, enter through a cut or crack in the skin. It often
        develops at sites of skin injuries such as cuts, insect bites, or
        surgical incisions.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">Risk factors for cellulitis include:</p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>A weakened immune system</li>
        <li>
          Skin conditions causing breaks in the skin, such as eczema or
          athlete’s foot
        </li>
        <li>Intravenous (IV) drug use</li>
        <li>Diabetes</li>
        <li>A history of cellulitis</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Diagnosis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        A doctor can usually diagnose cellulitis by physical examination. This
        may reveal:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Swelling of the skin</li>
        <li>Redness and warmth in the affected area</li>
        <li>Swollen glands</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Depending on the severity, the doctor may monitor the area for a few
        days to observe any spread of redness or swelling. In some cases, blood
        tests or wound cultures may be performed to confirm the presence of
        bacteria.
      </p>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Treatment</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Your doctor will typically prescribe a 10- to 21-day regimen of oral
        antibiotics to treat cellulitis. The duration of the treatment will
        depend on the severity of the condition. Even if symptoms improve within
        a few days, it's crucial to complete the entire prescribed course to
        ensure proper treatment. Monitor your condition during this time to
        ensure symptoms improve. In most cases, symptoms should improve or
        disappear within a few days.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        In some cases, pain relievers may be prescribed. Rest is essential until
        symptoms improve. While resting, elevate the affected limb higher than
        your heart to reduce swelling.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Contact your doctor immediately if you don’t respond to treatment within
        three days of starting antibiotics, if symptoms worsen, or if you
        develop a fever. Cellulitis should resolve within seven to 10 days of
        starting antibiotics. Severe infections may require longer treatment,
        especially in individuals with chronic diseases or weakened immune
        systems.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Hospitalization may be necessary for individuals with certain medical
        conditions or risk factors. Your doctor may recommend hospitalization if
        you:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Have a high temperature</li>
        <li>Have high blood pressure</li>
        <li>Have an infection that doesn’t improve with antibiotics</li>
        <li>Have a compromised immune system due to other diseases</li>
        <li>Require IV antibiotics when oral antibiotics don’t work</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Possible Complications</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        In some cases, cellulitis can spread throughout the body, affecting the
        lymph nodes and bloodstream. Rarely, it can spread to deeper tissue
        layers. Potential complications include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>A blood infection</li>
        <li>A bone infection</li>
        <li>Inflammation of lymph vessels</li>
        <li>Tissue death, or gangrene</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Preventing Cellulitis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        To prevent cellulitis, clean any break in the skin immediately and apply
        antibiotic ointment regularly. Cover the wound with a bandage and change
        it daily until a scab forms. Monitor wounds for signs of infection, such
        as redness, drainage, or pain.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Individuals with poor circulation or pre-existing conditions that
        increase the risk of cellulitis should take extra precautions,
        including:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Keeping skin moisturized to prevent cracking</li>
        <li>
          Promptly treating superficial skin infections, such as athlete's foot
        </li>
        <li>Wearing protective equipment during activities</li>
        <li>Inspecting feet daily for signs of injury or infection</li>
      </ul>
