        Clubfoot is a deformity of the foot where one or both feet are turned
        inward. This condition affects the bones, muscles, tendons, and blood
        vessels. It is present at birth and tends to occur more frequently in
        boys than girls.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Causes</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The exact cause of clubfoot is unknown (idiopathic), but it is believed
        to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Risk Factors</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Family history:</strong> If either parent or a sibling has had
          clubfoot, the baby is more likely to have it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Congenital conditions:</strong> Clubfoot may be associated
          with other skeletal abnormalities like spina bifida.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Environment:</strong> Smoking during pregnancy, infections, or
          recreational drug use can increase the risk.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Amniotic fluid levels:</strong> Too little amniotic fluid
          during pregnancy may raise the likelihood of clubfoot.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Symptoms of Clubfoot</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          The top of the foot is twisted downward and inward, increasing the
          arch and turning the heel inward.
        </li>
        <li>
          The foot may appear severely twisted, sometimes looking as if it is
          upside down.
        </li>
        <li>The calf muscles in the affected leg are underdeveloped.</li>
        <li>
          The affected foot may be up to 1/2 inch shorter than the other foot.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Despite the appearance, clubfoot itself does not cause pain or
        discomfort.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Diagnosis</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Clubfoot is typically diagnosed immediately after birth based on the
        foot's shape and positioning. Occasionally, X-rays may be used to assess
        severity, but they are usually unnecessary. In some cases, clubfoot can
        be detected during prenatal ultrasound exams.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Treatment</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The goal of treatment is to straighten the foot so it can grow and
        develop normally. Treatment options include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Nonsurgical treatments:</strong> The Ponseti method, which
          involves gentle stretching and casting, is the most common treatment
          in the U.S. It typically takes 2 to 3 months. Other approaches include
          taping, physical therapy, and splinting.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Braces:</strong> Braces are used to prevent relapse.
          Initially, they are worn for 23 hours daily for up to 3 months, then
          only at night for 2 to 4 years.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Surgery:</strong> If nonsurgical treatments are ineffective,
          surgery may be necessary. Depending on the severity, surgical wires,
          pins, or a cast may be used to maintain the corrected position.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Most infants with clubfoot do not require surgery. For those who do,
        multiple procedures may be needed to address recurring deformities as
        the child grows.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Complications</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Clubfoot typically doesn't cause significant problems until your child
        begins to stand and walk. With treatment, most children walk fairly
        normally but may face challenges such as:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li><strong>Movement:</strong> Slightly limited mobility.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Shoe size:</strong> The affected foot may be up to 1 1/2 sizes
          smaller than the unaffected foot.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Calf size:</strong> Smaller calf muscles on the affected side.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        However, untreated clubfoot can lead to more serious complications,
        including:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li><strong>Arthritis:</strong> Increased likelihood of arthritis.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Poor self-image:</strong> The unusual appearance of the foot
          may impact self-esteem during the teen years.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Inability to walk normally:</strong> Severe twisting of the
          ankle may prevent walking on the sole of the foot, causing
          compensation by walking on the ball, outside, or top of the foot.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Walking adjustments:</strong> These may limit natural calf
          muscle growth, cause large sores or calluses, and result in an awkward
          gait.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Prevention</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The exact cause of clubfoot is unknown, making complete prevention
        difficult. However, pregnant individuals can reduce the risk of birth
        defects by:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Not smoking or spending time in smoky environments.</li>
        <li>Not drinking alcohol.</li>
        <li>Avoiding drugs not approved by a doctor.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Key Points</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Clubfoot is a deformity where one or both feet turn inward.</li>
        <li>Children with a family history of clubfoot are at higher risk.</li>
        <li>
          It causes the heel to point downward, and the forefoot turns inward,
          giving the foot a short, broad appearance.
        </li>
        <li>Most cases are diagnosed at birth.</li>
        <li>
          Treatment includes stretching and casting, with surgery as an option
          if other methods are ineffective.
        </li>
