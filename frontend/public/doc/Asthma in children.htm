      <h1 class="acne-page-title">Asthma in Children</h1>
      <p class="acne-main-text acne-left-img">
        In childhood asthma, the lungs and airways become easily inflamed when
        exposed to certain triggers, such as inhaling airborne pollen or
        catching a cold or another respiratory infection. Childhood asthma can
        cause bothersome daily symptoms that interfere with play, sports,
        school, and sleep. In some children, unmanaged asthma can cause
        dangerous asthma attacks.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Childhood asthma isn't a different disease from asthma in adults, but
        children face unique challenges. It is a leading cause of emergency
        department visits, hospitalizations, and missed school days. Although
        childhood asthma can't be cured and may continue into adulthood, the
        right treatment can help keep symptoms under control and prevent damage
        to growing lungs.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Symptoms</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Common childhood asthma signs and symptoms include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Frequent, intermittent coughing</li>
        <li>A whistling or wheezing sound when exhaling</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath</li>
        <li>Chest congestion or tightness</li>
        <li>Chest pain, particularly in younger children</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Other signs and symptoms include:</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Trouble sleeping due to shortness of breath, coughing, or wheezing
        </li>
        <li>
          Bouts of coughing or wheezing that worsen with respiratory infections
          like colds or flu
        </li>
        <li>Delayed recovery or bronchitis after respiratory infections</li>
        <li>Difficulty breathing that may limit play or exercise</li>
        <li>Fatigue, potentially from poor sleep</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The first signs of asthma in young children may be recurrent wheezing
        triggered by a respiratory virus. Asthma linked with respiratory
        allergies becomes more common as children grow older. Symptoms vary from
        child to child and may improve or worsen over time.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        It may be challenging to determine if your child's symptoms are due to
        asthma or another condition, as periodic or persistent wheezing and
        similar symptoms can be caused by infectious bronchitis or other
        respiratory problems.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">When to See a Doctor</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Take your child to see a doctor as soon as possible if you suspect
        asthma. Early treatment can help control day-to-day symptoms and may
        prevent asthma attacks.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Make an appointment if you notice:</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Constant or intermittent coughing, or coughing linked to physical
          activity
        </li>
        <li>Wheezing or whistling sounds when exhaling</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath or rapid breathing</li>
        <li>Complaints of chest tightness</li>
        <li>Repeated episodes of suspected bronchitis or pneumonia</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Children with asthma might say things like, "My chest feels funny" or
        "I'm always coughing." Listen for nighttime coughing, which may or may
        not wake your child. Strong emotions, such as crying or laughing, can
        also trigger coughing or wheezing.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        If your child is diagnosed with asthma, creating an asthma action plan
        can help you and other caregivers monitor symptoms and know what to do
        if an asthma attack occurs.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Causes</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The underlying causes of childhood asthma aren't fully understood.
        Generally, an overly sensitive immune system plays a role. Some factors
        thought to be involved include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Inherited traits</li>
        <li>Certain types of airway infections at a very young age</li>
        <li>
          Exposure to environmental factors, such as cigarette smoke or other
          air pollution
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Increased immune system sensitivity causes the lungs and airways to
        swell and produce mucus in response to certain triggers. Reaction to a
        trigger may be delayed, making it difficult to identify. Triggers vary
        from child to child and can include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Viral infections like the common cold</li>
        <li>Exposure to air pollutants, such as tobacco smoke</li>
        <li>Allergies to dust mites, pet dander, pollen, or mold</li>
        <li>Physical activity</li>
        <li>Weather changes or cold air</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Sometimes, asthma symptoms occur without any apparent triggers.
      </p>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Risk Factors</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Factors that may increase your child's likelihood of developing asthma
        include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Exposure to tobacco smoke</li>
        <li>
          Previous allergic reactions, including skin reactions, food allergies,
          or hay fever (allergic rhinitis)
        </li>
        <li>A family history of asthma, allergic rhinitis, hives, or eczema</li>
        <li>
          Living in an urban area with increased exposure to air pollution
        </li>
        <li>Obesity</li>
        <li>
          Respiratory conditions, such as chronic rhinitis, sinusitis, or
          pneumonia
        </li>
        <li>Heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD)</li>
        <li>Being male</li>
        <li>Being black</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Complications</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Asthma may cause a number of complications, including:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Severe asthma attacks requiring emergency treatment or hospital care
        </li>
        <li>Permanent narrowing of the airways (bronchial tubes)</li>
        <li>Missed school days or getting behind in school</li>
        <li>Poor sleep and fatigue</li>
        <li>Symptoms that interfere with play, sports, or other activities</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Prevention</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Careful planning and avoiding asthma triggers are the best ways to
        prevent asthma attacks:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Limit exposure to asthma triggers by helping your child avoid
          allergens and irritants that trigger asthma symptoms.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid smoking around your child. Tobacco smoke exposure during infancy
          is a strong risk factor for childhood asthma.
        </li>
        <li>
          Encourage your child to stay active. Controlled asthma allows for
          regular physical activity, which can improve lung function.
        </li>
        <li>
          See the doctor regularly. Donâ€™t ignore signs that asthma may be
          uncontrolled, such as frequent use of a quick-relief inhaler.
        </li>
        <li>
          Help your child maintain a healthy weight, as obesity can worsen
          asthma symptoms and lead to other health issues.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep heartburn under control, as acid reflux can worsen asthma
          symptoms.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Diagnosis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Asthma can be hard to diagnose. The doctor will consider symptom
        frequency and may use tests to rule out other conditions and determine
        the cause.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Conditions with asthma-like symptoms:</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Rhinitis</li>
        <li>Sinusitis</li>
        <li>Acid reflux (GERD)</li>
        <li>Airway abnormalities</li>
        <li>Vocal cord dysfunction</li>
        <li>Respiratory tract infections, such as bronchiolitis and RSV</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Diagnosis may involve lung function tests for children over age 5,
        measuring how quickly and how much air is exhaled. For younger children,
        diagnosis may rely on observing symptoms over time.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Treatment</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The goal of asthma treatment is to keep symptoms under control.
        Effective treatment allows:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Minimal or no symptoms</li>
        <li>Few or no asthma flare-ups</li>
        <li>Normal physical activities</li>
        <li>Minimal use of quick-relief inhalers</li>
        <li>Few or no medication side effects</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Treatment involves both preventive measures and managing flare-ups. The
        right medication depends on age, symptoms, and triggers.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Long-term control medications include:</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Inhaled corticosteroids:</strong> Medications like fluticasone
          (Flovent), budesonide (Pulmicort), and mometasone (Asmanex) reduce
          inflammation. Benefits may take days to weeks, with minor growth
          impact in children.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Leukotriene modifiers:</strong> Oral medications such as
          montelukast (Singulair) and zileuton (Zyflo) help prevent symptoms for
          up to 24 hours. Rarely, these may cause psychological side effects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Combination inhalers:</strong> These include corticosteroids
          and long-acting beta agonists (LABA), such as Advair and Symbicort.
          LABA medications should always be combined with corticosteroids for
          safety.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Theophylline:</strong> A daily pill that helps relax muscles
          around the airways. Although less common, itâ€™s still used for
          maintaining open airways.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Quick-Relief Medications</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Quick-relief medications quickly open swollen airways that limit
        breathing. Also called rescue medications, they are used as needed for
        rapid, short-term symptom relief during an asthma attack â€” or before
        exercise if your child's doctor recommends it.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">
        Types of quick-relief medications include:
      </h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Short-acting beta agonists:</strong> Inhaled bronchodilator
          medications, such as albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA) and
          levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA), act within minutes and last several hours
          to ease symptoms during an asthma attack.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ipratropium (Atrovent HFA):</strong> Prescribed for immediate
          symptom relief, this bronchodilator relaxes the airways, making it
          easier to breathe. It's mainly used for emphysema and chronic
          bronchitis but can treat asthma attacks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Oral and intravenous corticosteroids:</strong> Medications
          like prednisone and methylprednisolone relieve airway inflammation
          from severe asthma, used short-term due to potential long-term side
          effects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Immunomodulatory agents:</strong> Mepolizumab (Nucala) may be
          suitable for children with severe eosinophilic asthma.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Treatment for Allergy-Induced Asthma</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        If your child's asthma is triggered or worsened by allergies, allergy
        treatment may help. Options include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Omalizumab (Xolair):</strong> For people with allergies and
          severe asthma, this medication reduces the immune response to
          allergens like pollen, dust mites, and pet dander. Administered by
          injection every two to four weeks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Allergy medications:</strong> Includes oral and nasal
          antihistamines, decongestants, and nasal sprays (corticosteroid,
          cromolyn, and ipratropium).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Allergy shots (immunotherapy):</strong> Given weekly for a few
          months, then monthly for 3-5 years, gradually reducing the immune
          system's response to specific allergens.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Inhaled Medication Devices</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Inhaled short- and long-term control medications are used by inhaling a
        measured dose:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Older children and teens may use a handheld device like a pressurized
          metered dose inhaler or an inhaler that releases a fine powder.
        </li>
        <li>
          Infants and toddlers need a face mask attached to a metered dose
          inhaler or nebulizer to ensure correct dosing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Babies use a nebulizer, which turns liquid medication into droplets.
          The baby wears a face mask and breathes normally while receiving
          medication.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Steps to Reduce Exposure to Triggers</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Reducing exposure to asthma triggers can lessen the likelihood of asthma
        attacks. Steps include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Maintain low humidity at home:</strong> In damp climates,
          consider a dehumidifier.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Keep indoor air clean:</strong> Have a professional check your
          HVAC system annually, change filters regularly, and consider a
          small-particle filter.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reduce pet dander:</strong> Avoid pets with fur or feathers if
          your child is allergic. Bathing or grooming pets regularly can also
          help.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use your air conditioner:</strong> Reduces airborne pollen and
          dust mites, while lowering indoor humidity. If no air conditioning,
          keep windows closed during pollen season.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Minimize dust:</strong> Use dust-proof covers for bedding,
          replace carpeting with hard flooring, and use washable curtains and
          blinds.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clean regularly:</strong> Clean your home weekly to remove
          dust and allergens.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reduce exposure to cold air:</strong> If cold air worsens
          asthma, wearing a face mask outside can help.
        </li>
      </ul>
