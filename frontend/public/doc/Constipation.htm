      <h1 class="acne-page-title">Constipation in Children</h1>

      <!-- <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Overview</h2> -->
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Constipation in children is a common issue where they experience
        infrequent bowel movements or hard, dry stools. While early toilet
        training and dietary changes often contribute to constipation, most
        cases are temporary. Encouraging dietary adjustments, such as consuming
        fiber-rich fruits and vegetables and staying hydrated, can alleviate
        symptoms. In some cases, laxatives may be used with a doctor's approval.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Symptoms</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Signs and symptoms of constipation in children may include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Less than three bowel movements a week</li>
        <li>Hard, dry, and difficult-to-pass stools</li>
        <li>Large-diameter stools that may obstruct the toilet</li>
        <li>Pain during bowel movements</li>
        <li>Abdominal pain</li>
        <li>Traces of liquid or clay-like stool in underwear</li>
        <li>Blood on the surface of hard stool</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        If your child fears painful bowel movements, they may avoid using the
        toilet, displaying behaviors such as crossing legs, clenching buttocks,
        or twisting their body.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">When to See a Doctor</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        While constipation in children is usually not serious, chronic
        constipation can lead to complications or indicate an underlying
        condition. Consult a doctor if constipation lasts more than two weeks or
        is accompanied by:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Vomiting</li>
        <li>Blood in the stool</li>
        <li>Abdominal swelling</li>
        <li>Weight loss</li>
        <li>Painful anal fissures</li>
        <li>Intestinal protrusion from the anus (rectal prolapse)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Causes</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Constipation occurs when stool moves too slowly through the digestive
        tract, causing it to become hard and dry. Contributing factors include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Withholding:</strong> Children may ignore the urge to poop due
          to fear of the toilet, reluctance to stop playing, or previous painful
          bowel movements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Toilet Training Issues:</strong> Starting toilet training too
          early or turning it into a battle of wills may lead to stool
          withholding becoming an involuntary habit.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dietary Changes:</strong> Insufficient fiber or fluids, or
          transitioning from an all-liquid diet to solid foods, can lead to
          constipation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Routine Changes:</strong> Travel, stress, hot weather, or
          starting school may disrupt bowel habits.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Medications:</strong> Certain antidepressants and other drugs
          can contribute to constipation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cow's Milk Allergy:</strong> An allergy to cow's milk or
          excessive dairy consumption may cause constipation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Family History:</strong> A genetic or environmental
          predisposition may increase the risk of constipation in children.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Medical Conditions:</strong> Rarely, constipation may signal
          anatomic malformations or metabolic or digestive system issues.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Risk Factors</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Constipation in children is more likely in kids who:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Are sedentary</li>
        <li>Don't eat enough fiber</li>
        <li>Don't drink enough fluids</li>
        <li>Take certain medications, including some antidepressants</li>
        <li>Have a medical condition affecting the anus or rectum</li>
        <li>Have a family history of constipation</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Diagnosis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Your child's doctor will typically perform the following to diagnose
        constipation:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Medical History:</strong> The doctor will ask about your
          child's past illnesses, diet, and activity patterns.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Physical Exam:</strong> This may include inserting a gloved
          finger into the anus to check for abnormalities or impacted stool.
          Stool may be tested for blood.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        For severe cases, additional tests might include abdominal X-rays,
        anorectal manometry, barium enema X-rays, rectal biopsy, transit
        studies, or blood tests.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Treatment</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Depending on the circumstances, treatments may include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Fiber Supplements:</strong> Over-the-counter products like
          Metamucil or Citrucel may help, but your child needs to drink at least
          32 ounces of water daily.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Glycerin Suppositories:</strong> These can soften stool for
          children unable to swallow pills.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Laxatives or Enemas:</strong> Products like polyethylene
          glycol (MiraLax) and mineral oil may be prescribed to clear blockages.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hospital Enema:</strong> For severe cases, a stronger enema
          may be administered in the hospital.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Always consult your doctor before using laxatives or enemas and follow
        proper dosing instructions.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Complications</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">Chronic constipation may lead to:</p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Painful anal fissures</li>
        <li>Rectal prolapse</li>
        <li>Stool withholding</li>
        <li>Encopresis (impacted stool leaking from the colon and rectum)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Prevention</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">To prevent constipation in children:</p>
      <ul class="acne-list">

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Lifestyle and Home Remedies</h2>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>High-Fiber Diet:</strong> Gradually increase fiber intake to

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Adequate Fluids:</strong> Encourage water and limit excessive

        </li>
        <li>
