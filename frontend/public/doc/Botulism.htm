        Botulism (or botulism poisoning) is a rare but very serious illness that
        spreads through food, contact with contaminated soil, or an open wound.
        Without early treatment, botulism can lead to paralysis, breathing
        difficulties, and death.
      </p>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Types of Botulism</h2>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Infant botulism</li>
        <li>Foodborne botulism</li>
        <li>Wound botulism</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Botulism poisoning is caused by a toxin produced by the bacteria
        <i>Clostridium botulinum</i>. These bacteria thrive in oxygen-free
        environments, such as improperly canned foods. The Centers for Disease
        Control and Prevention (CDC) reports approximately 145 cases of botulism
        annually in the United States, with a 3 to 5 percent fatality rate.
      </p>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Symptoms</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Symptoms of botulism can appear between 6 hours and 10 days after
        infection. For infant and foodborne botulism, symptoms typically appear
        12 to 36 hours after consuming contaminated food.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Early Signs of Infant Botulism</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Constipation</li>

        </li>
        <li>Paralysis</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Signs of Foodborne or Wound Botulism</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Difficulty swallowing or speaking</li>
        <li>Facial weakness on both sides of the face</li>
        <li>Blurred vision</li>
        <li>Drooping eyelids</li>
        <li>Trouble breathing</li>
        <li>
          Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps (only in foodborne botulism)
        </li>
        <li>Paralysis</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Causes</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The CDC reports that 65 percent of botulism cases occur in infants or
        children younger than 1 year of age. Infant botulism is typically the
        result of exposure to contaminated soil or eating foods containing
        botulism spores. Honey and corn syrup are two examples of foods that can
        harbor botulism spores. These spores grow inside the intestinal tract of
        infants, releasing the botulism toxin. Older children and adults have
        natural defenses that prevent the bacteria from growing.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        According to the CDC, around 15 percent of botulism cases are foodborne.
        These cases often result from home-canned or improperly processed
        commercially canned foods. The World Health Organization (WHO)
        identifies the following as potential sources of botulism toxin:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Preserved vegetables with low acid content, such as beets, spinach,
          mushrooms, and green beans
        </li>
        <li>Canned tuna fish</li>
        <li>Fermented, smoked, and salted fish</li>
        <li>Meat products, such as ham and sausage</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Wound botulism accounts for 20 percent of all botulism cases and occurs
        when botulism spores enter an open wound. This type has increased
        recently due to drug use, as spores are commonly present in heroin and
        cocaine.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Botulism is not passed from person to person. It requires the
        consumption of spores or toxin through food, or the toxin must enter a
        wound, to cause symptoms.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Diagnosis</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        If botulism is suspected, immediate medical attention is crucial. Early
        diagnosis and treatment are essential for survival. To diagnose
        botulism, a doctor will conduct a physical exam, noting any signs or
        symptoms. They will inquire about foods consumed within the past few
        days and check for any wounds.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        In infants, the doctor will check for physical symptoms and inquire
        about foods eaten, such as honey or corn syrup. Blood or stool samples
        may be taken to analyze for toxins, although results may take days.
        Diagnosis often relies on clinical observation.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Additional Diagnostic Tests</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Electromyography (EMG) to evaluate muscle response</li>
        <li>Imaging scans to detect internal damage to the head or brain</li>
        <li>
          Spinal fluid tests to determine if infection or injury to the brain or
          spinal cord is causing symptoms
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Treatment</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          For foodborne and wound botulism, doctors administer an antitoxin as
          soon as possible after diagnosis.
        </li>
        <li>
          In infants, botulism immune globulin blocks the neurotoxins
          circulating in the blood.
        </li>
        <li>
          Severe cases may require a ventilator to support breathing, and
          recovery may take weeks or months.
        </li>
        <li>
          Long-term therapy and rehabilitation may be necessary for severe
          cases.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is a vaccine for botulism, but its effectiveness is not fully
          tested and has side effects.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Prevention</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Follow proper canning techniques at home, ensuring adequate heat and
          acidity levels.
        </li>
        <li>Be cautious with fermented fish or other aquatic game foods.</li>
        <li>Discard open or bulging cans of commercially prepared food.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate oils infused with garlic or herbs.</li>
        <li>
          Keep cooked potatoes in aluminum foil hot or refrigerate them
          immediately.
        </li>
        <li>Boil foods for 10 minutes to destroy botulism toxin.</li>
        <li>
          Avoid feeding infants honey or corn syrup, as these may contain
          <i>Clostridium botulinum</i> spores.
        </li>
