      <h1 class="acne-page-title">Congenital Heart Defects</h1>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        If your child has a congenital heart defect, it means they were born
        with a structural problem in their heart. Some defects are minor and
        don't require treatment, while others may need multiple surgeries over
        several years. Understanding your child's condition can help you prepare
        for the future.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Symptoms</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Serious congenital heart defects often appear shortly after birth or in
        early infancy. Symptoms include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Pale gray or blue skin color (cyanosis)</li>
        <li>Rapid breathing</li>
        <li>Swelling in the legs, abdomen, or around the eyes</li>
        <li>
          Shortness of breath during feedings, leading to poor weight gain
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">In older children, symptoms may include:</p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Shortness of breath during exercise or activity</li>
        <li>Fatigue during exercise or activity</li>
        <li>Fainting during exercise</li>
        <li>Swelling in the hands, ankles, or feet</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Causes</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Congenital heart defects develop during the first six weeks of pregnancy
        when the heart begins to form. While the exact cause is often unknown, a
        combination of genetic and environmental factors may contribute.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Types of Heart Defects</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Congenital heart defects are classified into the following categories:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Holes in the heart:</strong> These allow oxygen-poor blood to
          mix with oxygen-rich blood. Examples include atrial septal defects,
          ventricular septal defects, and patent ductus arteriosus.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Obstructed blood flow:</strong> Narrowed valves or vessels
          cause the heart to work harder. Examples include pulmonary stenosis
          and aortic stenosis.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Abnormal blood vessels:</strong> Improperly formed or
          positioned vessels, such as in transposition of the great arteries or
          coarctation of the aorta.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Heart valve abnormalities:</strong> Faulty valves prevent
          smooth blood flow, as seen in Ebstein's anomaly and pulmonary atresia.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Underdeveloped heart:</strong> Parts of the heart, like in
          hypoplastic left heart syndrome, don't fully develop.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Combination of defects:</strong> Some children are born with
          multiple defects, such as in Tetralogy of Fallot.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Risk Factors</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Several environmental and genetic factors may increase the risk of
        congenital heart defects:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Rubella (German measles):</strong> Contracting rubella during
          pregnancy can affect heart development.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Diabetes:</strong> Controlling diabetes before and during
          pregnancy reduces risk.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Medications:</strong> Certain drugs, including ACE inhibitors
          and isotretinoin, may increase the risk.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Alcohol and smoking:</strong> Both are linked to a higher
          likelihood of congenital heart defects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Heredity:</strong> Genetic syndromes like Down syndrome or
          deletions on chromosome 22 are associated with heart defects.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Diagnosis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        If a congenital heart defect is suspected, various diagnostic tools may
        be used:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Fetal echocardiogram:</strong> An ultrasound before birth to
          detect defects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Echocardiogram:</strong> Produces images of the heart to
          assess abnormalities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Electrocardiogram (ECG):</strong> Measures electrical activity
          of the heart.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chest X-ray:</strong> Identifies enlargement of the heart or
          fluid in the lungs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pulse oximetry:</strong> Measures oxygen levels in the blood.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cardiac catheterization:</strong> Provides detailed images and
          allows certain treatments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cardiovascular MRI:</strong> Offers high-resolution images for
          adolescents and adults.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Treatment</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Some congenital heart defects resolve on their own, while others require
        medical intervention. Treatment options include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Catheterization procedures:</strong> Minimally invasive
          techniques to repair defects without opening the chest.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Open-heart surgery:</strong> Used for more complex defects,
          requiring chest incisions to access and repair the heart.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Heart transplant:</strong> For severe defects that cannot be
          repaired surgically.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Medications:</strong> Drugs such as ACE inhibitors, beta
          blockers, and diuretics help manage symptoms and ease heart stress.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Some treatments may need to be performed in stages over several years,
        and others might require follow-up procedures as the child grows.
      </p>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">
        Long-Term Treatment for Congenital Heart Defects
      </h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Children with congenital heart defects may require multiple surgeries
        and lifelong care. While many can lead normal lives post-treatment,
        ongoing monitoring and adjustments are often necessary.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Lifelong Monitoring and Treatment</h2>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          After corrective surgery, children need regular follow-ups with a
          pediatric cardiologist. As they age, care transitions to an adult
          congenital cardiologist to manage potential health issues that may
          arise over time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Encourage your child to stay informed about their condition and share
          their medical history with healthcare providers throughout life.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Exercise Restrictions</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Many children with congenital heart defects can engage in normal
        activities, but some may need to limit exercise. Your child's doctor
        will provide guidance on safe activities.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Infection Prevention</h2>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Some heart defects increase the risk of infections, such as infective
          endocarditis. Antibiotics may be required before surgeries or dental
          procedures.
        </li>
        <li>
          Children with prosthetic devices or materials in their heart are at a
          higher risk of infection. Consult your child's cardiologist for
          preventive measures.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Complications</h2>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Congestive heart failure:</strong> Rapid breathing and poor
          weight gain may indicate heart failure in babies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Slower growth and development:</strong> Children with severe
          defects may experience delayed growth and milestones.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Heart rhythm problems:</strong> Arrhythmias can result from
          the defect or scar tissue after surgery.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cyanosis:</strong> A grayish-blue skin tone caused by mixing
          oxygen-poor and oxygen-rich blood.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stroke:</strong> Blood clots traveling through heart defects
          may increase the risk of stroke.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Emotional issues:</strong> Physical restrictions or learning
          challenges can lead to emotional insecurities. Seek professional
          support if needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lifelong follow-up:</strong> Regular cardiologist visits are
          essential to monitor risks like endocarditis, heart failure, or valve
          issues.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Prevention</h2>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Vaccination:</strong> Get vaccinated for rubella before
          pregnancy to prevent heart development issues.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Manage chronic conditions:</strong> Properly control diabetes
          or epilepsy to reduce risks during pregnancy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Avoid harmful substances:</strong> Steer clear of alcohol,
          smoking, and strong chemicals during pregnancy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Take folic acid:</strong> A daily multivitamin with 400
          micrograms of folic acid may reduce the risk of heart defects.
        </li>
      </ul>
