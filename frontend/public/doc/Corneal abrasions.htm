      <h1 class="acne-page-title">Corneal Abrasions</h1>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Corneal abrasions are a common type of eye injury in kids. They happen
        when something, like sand or dirt, gets into the eye.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        A corneal abrasion is a scratch or scrape on the cornea. This is the
        clear, dome-shaped surface that covers the front of the eye.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Though sometimes painful, corneal abrasions usually aren't serious and
        most heal within a few days. Long-term vision is rarely affected.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Causes</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        There are many things that can cause an abrasion to your child’s cornea.
        The more common causes include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Foreign bodies in the eye. These include dirt, pebbles, and insects.
        </li>
        <li>Scratch from a toy or fingernail.</li>
        <li>
          Contact lenses that don’t fit or aren’t cared for well. This may occur
          in older children.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        When these objects come into contact with the surface of your child’s
        eye, they can cause an abrasion.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Symptoms</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The following are the most common symptoms of a corneal abrasion.
        However, each child may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may
        include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Pain and redness in the eye</li>
        <li>Tearing of that eye</li>
        <li>Pain when the child looks at a light</li>
        <li>Excessive blinking in the affected eye</li>
        <li>A younger child may hold that eye shut</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The symptoms of a corneal abrasion may resemble other eye conditions or
        medical problems. Always consult your child’s doctor for a diagnosis.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Diagnosis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Diagnosis is usually made based on a complete medical history and
        physical examination of your child’s eye. Local anesthetic drops may be
        placed in the eye in order to examine the child. In addition, your
        child’s doctor may use a fluorescein stain to help confirm the
        diagnosis.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        This is done by placing a small amount of a dye in the child’s eye. The
        stain does not hurt the child. A special light is then used to look at
        the surface of the cornea, and any abrasion or scratch can be seen.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Treatment</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Specific treatment for a corneal abrasion will be determined by your
        child's doctor based on:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Your child's age, overall health, and medical history</li>
        <li>Extent of the injury</li>
        <li>
          Your child's tolerance for specific medications, procedures, or
          therapies
        </li>
        <li>Expectations for the course of the injury</li>
        <li>Your opinion or preference</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Most corneal abrasions heal quickly and do not cause any permanent
        damage to the eye. Treatment may include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          If a foreign body is seen in the eye, it may be removed with a small
          cotton applicator, or by washing the eye out with a saline solution.
        </li>
        <li>
          Antibiotic eye drops or ointment or steroid eye drops may be placed in
          the eye.
        </li>
        <li>
          A patch over the eye may be used to help decrease your child's level
          of discomfort. A patch is usually required for 12 to 24 hours
          following a corneal abrasion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Close follow-up with your child's doctor is needed to assure that the
          abrasion heals completely.
        </li>
        <li>
          Severe abrasions or cuts into the cornea may be managed by an eye
          specialist because of the increased risk of damage to the eye.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Key Points</h2>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>A corneal abrasion is a scratch or scrape to the cornea.</li>
        <li>
          Most corneal abrasions heal quickly. They usually don’t cause any
          permanent damage to the eye.
        </li>
        <li>
          Treatment may include removing a foreign body from the eye, medicine,
          or wearing an eye patch.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure your child doesn’t rub his or her eyes. This can make the
          abrasion worse.
        </li>
        <li>
          Abrasions can often be prevented. Your child should wear protective
          eyewear when doing activities that put his or her eyes at risk.
        </li>
