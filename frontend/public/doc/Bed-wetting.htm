      <h1 class="acne-page-title">Bed-wetting</h1>
      <p class="acne-main-text acne-left-img">
        Bed-wetting, also known as nighttime incontinence or nocturnal enuresis,
        is involuntary urination during sleep after the age at which nighttime
        bladder control is typically developed. It is common among children and
        often just a normal part of development.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        While bed-wetting before age 7 is usually not a concern, ongoing
        bed-wetting can be addressed with patience, understanding, and methods
        such as lifestyle changes, bladder training, moisture alarms, and
        medication.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Symptoms</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Most children achieve toilet training by age 5, but some may continue to
        experience bed-wetting between the ages of 5 and 7. After age 7, a small
        number of children may still wet the bed.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Causes</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Bed-wetting can occur due to various factors, including:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>A small bladder:</strong> The bladder may not be fully
          developed to hold nighttime urine.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Inability to recognize a full bladder:</strong> Immature
          bladder nerves may fail to wake the child.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hormone imbalance:</strong> A lack of anti-diuretic hormone
          (ADH) may increase nighttime urine production.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Urinary tract infection:</strong> Symptoms include
          bed-wetting, frequent urination, and pain during urination.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sleep apnea:</strong> Obstructive sleep apnea, often due to
          enlarged tonsils or adenoids, can cause bed-wetting.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Diabetes:</strong> Bed-wetting can be an early sign of
          diabetes, accompanied by excessive thirst and fatigue.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chronic constipation:</strong> Dysfunctional muscles due to
          long-term constipation can contribute to bed-wetting.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Structural problems:</strong> Rarely, defects in the urinary
          or nervous system may be the cause.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Risk Factors</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Bed-wetting is twice as common in boys as in girls. Risk factors
        include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Stress and anxiety:</strong> Life changes such as becoming a
          sibling or starting school can trigger bed-wetting.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Family history:</strong> Children with parents who experienced
          bed-wetting are more likely to wet the bed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>ADHD:</strong> Bed-wetting is more common in children with
          attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Complications</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Although bed-wetting typically doesn’t cause physical health issues, it
        can lead to:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Guilt and embarrassment:</strong> These feelings can lower
          self-esteem.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Loss of social opportunities:</strong> Bed-wetting may prevent
          participation in activities like sleepovers or camps.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rashes:</strong> Prolonged contact with wet underwear can
          cause skin irritation or rashes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Diagnosis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        To identify the underlying cause of bed-wetting, your doctor may
        recommend the following:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Physical exam</li>
        <li>
          Discussion of symptoms, fluid intake, family history, bowel and
          bladder habits, and associated problems
        </li>
        <li>Urine tests to check for infections or diabetes</li>
        <li>
          Imaging tests of the kidneys or bladder to examine urinary tract
          structure
        </li>
        <li>Other urinary tract assessments, as needed</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Treatment</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Treatment depends on the child’s symptoms and underlying causes. Most
        children outgrow bed-wetting naturally, but options may include:
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Moisture Alarms</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Battery-operated devices that alert the child when wetness is detected
        </li>
        <li>Helps train the child to wake and use the toilet</li>
        <li>Requires consistent use for 1-3 months</li>
        <li>Low risk of relapse or side effects</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Medication</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Desmopressin (DDAVP):</strong> Reduces nighttime urine
          production but must be used cautiously.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Oxybutynin (Ditropan XL):</strong> Relaxes bladder muscles,
          increasing capacity for children with small bladders.
        </li>
        <li>
          Medications may not cure the problem but can provide temporary relief.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Lifestyle and Home Remedies</h2>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Limit fluids in the evening.</li>
        <li>Avoid beverages with caffeine.</li>
        <li>Encourage double voiding before bed.</li>
        <li>Promote regular toilet use throughout the day.</li>
        <li>Prevent rashes with morning hygiene and protective ointments.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Alternative Medicine</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Alternative treatments such as hypnosis, acupuncture, or herbal therapy
        have limited evidence of effectiveness. Consult your doctor before
        trying these methods.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Coping and Support</h2>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Be patient and supportive. Bed-wetting is involuntary and not the
          child’s fault.
        </li>
        <li>
          Plan for easy cleanup with waterproof mattress covers and extra
          bedding.
        </li>
        <li>
          Encourage your child to help with cleanup to foster a sense of
          control.
        </li>
        <li>
          Celebrate effort, not results. Use reward systems to motivate your
          child.
        </li>
      </ul>
