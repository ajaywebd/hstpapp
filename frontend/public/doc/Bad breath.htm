      <h1 class="acne-page-title">Bad Breath</h1>
      <p class="acne-main-text acne-left-img">
        Bad breath, medically known as halitosis, is a condition that even
        healthy children can sometimes experience. If you've noticed unpleasant
        breath in your child, there is hope. Most often, improper oral hygiene
        is the culprit.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Causes</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        There are several factors that can contribute to bad breath in children.
        Common causes include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Poor oral hygiene:</strong> Not brushing and flossing
          regularly can lead to plaque buildup, gum irritation, and bad breath.
          Ensure your child brushes their tongue as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dry mouth:</strong> Saliva helps cleanse the mouth. Reduced
          saliva production can cause xerostomia, contributing to bad breath.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mouth breathing:</strong> Breathing through the mouth, often
          due to nasal congestion or a sleep habit, reduces saliva, allowing
          bacteria to thrive.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bacteria on the tongue:</strong> Most odor-causing bacteria
          reside on the tongue. Regular tongue cleaning can prevent bad breath.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Infections in the mouth:</strong> Cavities, plaque buildup,
          mouth sores, or oral surgeries can lead to bad breath.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A foreign object:</strong> Objects lodged in a childâ€™s nose,
          such as tiny toys or food particles, can cause foul odors.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Certain foods:</strong> Foods like garlic, onions, and spices
          can impact breath freshness.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Medications:</strong> Certain medications release chemicals
          during breakdown, leading to bad breath.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Illness or conditions:</strong> Allergies, sinus infections,
          tonsillitis, or other illnesses may contribute to halitosis.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">How to Avoid Bad Breath</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Healthy teeth are crucial for a child's overall well-being. You can help
        your child avoid bad breath by creating a consistent oral care routine:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Encourage brushing twice daily with ADA-approved fluoride toothpaste.
          Supervise younger children to prevent swallowing toothpaste.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ensure your child brushes their tongue to remove bacteria that cause
          bad breath.
        </li>
        <li>Floss daily to remove food particles that cause odors.</li>
        <li>
          Replace toothbrushes every few months to maintain effectiveness.
        </li>
        <li>
          Schedule regular dental checkups and professional cleanings to prevent
          oral health issues, including halitosis.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Chronic Bad Breath in Children</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Most cases of bad breath resolve with improved oral hygiene. However,
        some children may experience chronic bad breath. If your child's dentist
        finds no oral health issues, you may be referred to a primary care
        physician for further tests to identify the underlying cause of
        halitosis.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Teaching children good dental care habits at an early age is essential
        for their long-term oral health as adults.
