      <h1 class="acne-page-title">Common Cold</h1>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The common cold is a viral infection of your nose and throat (upper
        respiratory tract). It's usually harmless, although it might not feel
        that way. Many types of viruses can cause a common cold. Children
        younger than 6 are at greatest risk of colds, but healthy adults can
        also expect to have two or three colds annually. Most people recover
        from a common cold in a week or 10 days. Symptoms might last longer in
        people who smoke. If symptoms don't improve, see your doctor.

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Symptoms</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Symptoms of a common cold typically appear one to three days after
        exposure to the virus. They can vary but often include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Runny or stuffy nose</li>
        <li>Sore throat</li>
        <li>Cough</li>
        <li>Congestion</li>
        <li>Slight body aches or mild headache</li>
        <li>Sneezing</li>
        <li>Low-grade fever</li>
        <li>Generally feeling unwell (malaise)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Nasal discharge may become thicker and change color as the cold
        progresses, which is not necessarily a sign of a bacterial infection.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">When to See a Doctor</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        While most colds resolve on their own, seek medical attention if your
        child experiences:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Fever of 100.4 F (38 C) in newborns up to 12 weeks</li>
        <li>Rising fever or fever lasting more than two days</li>
        <li>Worsening or non-improving symptoms</li>
        <li>Severe symptoms, such as intense headache or persistent cough</li>
        <li>Wheezing</li>
        <li>Ear pain</li>
        <li>Extreme fussiness or unusual drowsiness</li>
        <li>Lack of appetite</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Causes</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The most common cause of the common cold is rhinoviruses. A cold virus
        typically enters the body through the mouth, eyes, or nose and spreads
        via:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking</li>
        <li>Hand-to-hand contact with an infected person</li>
        <li>Sharing contaminated objects like utensils, toys, or telephones</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Risk Factors</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Factors that increase the risk of catching a cold include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Age (children under 6 are at higher risk)</li>
        <li>Weakened immune system</li>
        <li>Time of year (fall and winter)</li>
        <li>Exposure to cigarette smoke</li>
        <li>Being in crowded places, like schools or airplanes</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Complications</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Although usually mild, a cold can lead to complications such as:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Acute ear infection (otitis media): Symptoms include ear pain or
          green/yellow nasal discharge.
        </li>
        <li>Asthma: Colds can trigger asthma attacks.</li>
        <li>
          Acute sinusitis: Persistent colds may cause sinus inflammation or
          infection.
        </li>
        <li>
          Secondary infections: Strep throat, pneumonia, or croup may develop
          and require medical treatment.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Prevention</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        While there's no vaccine for the common cold, you can take precautions
        to reduce the risk of catching or spreading cold viruses:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water. Use
          alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap isn't available.
        </li>
        <li>
          Disinfect frequently touched surfaces like kitchen and bathroom
          counters.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use tissues when sneezing or coughing, dispose of them promptly, and
          wash your hands.
        </li>
        <li>
          Teach children to sneeze or cough into the bend of their elbow if no
          tissue is available.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid sharing utensils, glasses, or towels, and use labeled items for
          sick individuals.
        </li>
        <li>Stay away from close contact with people who have colds.</li>
        <li>
          Choose child care centers with strict hygiene policies and rules about
          sick children staying home.
        </li>
        <li>
          Maintain a healthy lifestyle, including good nutrition, exercise,
          sufficient sleep, and stress management.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Diagnosis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Common colds are usually diagnosed based on symptoms. If a bacterial
        infection or other condition is suspected, your doctor may order tests
        like a chest X-ray.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Treatment</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        There's no cure for the common cold. Treatment focuses on symptom
        relief. Antibiotics are ineffective against viruses and should only be
        used if a bacterial infection is present.
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Pain relievers:</strong> Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen
          can reduce fever, sore throat, and headaches. Avoid aspirin for
          children or teens recovering from flu-like symptoms due to Reye's
          syndrome risk.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Decongestant sprays:</strong> Adults can use nasal sprays for
          up to five days. They are not recommended for children under 6.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cough syrups:</strong> Over-the-counter cough medicines are
          not recommended for children under 4. For older children, follow label
          directions carefully to avoid overdose.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Lifestyle and Home Remedies</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        To ease symptoms and improve comfort during a cold:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Drink plenty of fluids like water, juice, or clear broth to stay
          hydrated. Avoid caffeine and alcohol.
        </li>
        <li>Eat chicken soup or warm fluids to soothe congestion.</li>
        <li>
          Rest and stay home if you're unwell to recover and prevent spreading
          the virus.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adjust room temperature and humidity. Use a cool-mist humidifier to
          moisten dry air and ease congestion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Soothe your throat with a saltwater gargle (1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of
          salt in 4 to 8 ounces of warm water).
        </li>
        <li>
          Use saline nasal drops to relieve congestion. For infants, suction
          nostrils gently with a bulb syringe after applying saline drops.
        </li>
      </ul>
