      <!-- <h2 class="acne-section-title">Overview</h2> -->
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Epilepsy originates from a Greek word meaning "to hold or seize." It
        refers to a neurological condition where individuals experience
        seizures, also known as convulsions, fits, or spells. Seizures occur due
        to abnormal electrical activity in the brain, causing uncontrolled
        muscle movements or other behavioral changes.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">What's a Seizure?</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        A seizure is a sudden change in behavior resulting from abnormal
        electrical activity in the brain. Seizures vary widely in symptoms,
        which may include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Falling down and shaking</li>
        <li>Stiffening</li>
        <li>Vomiting or drooling</li>
        <li>Urination or loss of bowel control</li>
        <li>Staring into space or jerking movements in one part of the body</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Some people experience an aura before a seizure, marked by unusual
        feelings, smells, or tastes.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Who Has Epilepsy?</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Approximately 3 million Americans, including individuals of all ages and
        races, have epilepsy. Seizures can begin at any age, often before age 10
        or after age 55. While epilepsy is not contagious, people with a family
        history of epilepsy may have a slightly higher risk.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Causes of Epilepsy</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">The causes of epilepsy include:</p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Severe head injuries</li>
        <li>Complications during birth</li>
        <li>Brain infections like meningitis</li>
        <li>Structural changes in the brain</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Genetic predisposition often plays a role, interacting with structural
        brain changes to increase the likelihood of seizures.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Symptoms</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Common symptoms of epilepsy and seizures include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Staring and unresponsiveness</li>
        <li>Confusion</li>
        <li>Jerks and twitches</li>
        <li>Wandering</li>
        <li>Shaking or falling</li>
        <li>Picking or lip-smacking behaviors</li>
      </ul>

        First Aid for Seizures :-
      </h2>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">For Non-Convulsive Seizures:</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Watch the person carefully to recognize the seizure.</li>
        <li>Speak quietly and calmly to the person.</li>
        <li>Explain to others what is happening.</li>
        <li>
          Guide the person gently to a safe area away from danger, such as
          water, machinery, or fire.
        </li>
        <li>Don't restrain the person or try to stop their movements.</li>
        <li>Stay with the person until they regain full consciousness.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">For Convulsive (Grand Mal) Seizures:</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Time the seizure.</li>
        <li>Look for an "epilepsy" or "seizure disorders" bracelet.</li>
        <li>Place the person on their side, away from hazardous objects.</li>
        <li>Do not put anything in the person’s mouth.</li>
        <li>Remove eyeglasses and loosen tight objects around the neck.</li>
        <li>
          Call emergency services (e.g., 9-1-1) if the seizure lasts more than
          five minutes or causes injury.
        </li>
        <li>Stay with the person until help arrives.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Diagnosis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Diagnosing epilepsy involves a complete physical and neurological
        examination. Key steps include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Electroencephalogram (EEG): Records electrical activity in the brain
          to identify epileptic discharges.
        </li>
        <li>
          Imaging Studies: High-resolution MRI and other scans such as PET,
          SPECT, or fMRI to detect abnormalities in the brain.
        </li>
        <li>
          Neuropsychological Testing: Evaluates the impact of epilepsy on
          cognitive and emotional functions, including memory and attention.
        </li>
        <li>
          Blood and Urine Tests: Analyzes blood cell counts, sugar,
          electrolytes, and other factors to rule out metabolic or genetic
          diseases.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Treatment Options :
      </h2>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">Anti-Epileptic Drugs (AEDs):</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Most children with epilepsy take AEDs to control seizures. While AEDs
        are effective for many, they do not cure epilepsy or stop seizures in
        progress. Side effects are possible but may subside as the body adjusts.
        Consult a healthcare provider before making any changes to medication.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">Ketogenic Diet:</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        For children who don’t respond to AEDs, the ketogenic diet, supervised
        by specialists and dietitians, may reduce the frequency or severity of
        seizures.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">Epilepsy Surgery:</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        In specific cases, surgery to remove the part of the brain causing
        seizures may be an option. The decision depends on the type and location
        of epilepsy in the brain.
