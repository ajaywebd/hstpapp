      <h1 class="acne-page-title">Enlarged Adenoids</h1>

      <!-- <h2 class="acne-section-title">Overview</h2> -->
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Adenoids are small patches of tissue located at the back of the throat,
        similar to the tonsils but positioned right above them. While tonsils
        are visible at the back of the throat, adenoids are not directly
        visible. Both are part of the immune system, helping to prevent and
        fight infections. Enlarged adenoids can cause various problems, but they
        are not essential and can often be treated by removal.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Causes</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Adenoids are present at birth and grow until a child is between the ages
        of 3 and 5. Normally, they begin to shrink after age 7 and significantly
        in adulthood. Enlarged adenoids can occur due to:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Infections causing temporary enlargement</li>
        <li>Allergies</li>
        <li>Enlargement from birth</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Although they usually shrink after an infection subsides, in some cases,
        they remain enlarged.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Symptoms</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Enlarged adenoids can cause several symptoms, including:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Blocked or stuffy nose</li>
        <li>Ear problems</li>
        <li>Snoring</li>
        <li>Sore throat</li>
        <li>Difficulty swallowing</li>
        <li>Swollen neck glands</li>
        <li>Breathing problems through the nose</li>
        <li>Sleep apnea</li>
        <li>Glue ear or fluid buildup in the middle ear</li>
        <li>Cracked lips and dry mouth</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Diagnosis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">Diagnosis involves:</p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Physical examination and symptom review</li>
        <li>Using a mirror or flexible endoscope to view the adenoids</li>
        <li>Blood tests to check for infections</li>
        <li>X-rays in certain cases</li>
        <li>Sleep studies for severe cases with potential sleep apnea</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Treatment</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Treatment depends on the severity of the condition:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Observation: If the adenoids are not causing severe problems, the
          doctor may wait to see if they shrink naturally.
        </li>
        <li>
          Medication: Nasal steroids may be prescribed to reduce size and
          inflammation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Surgery: An adenoidectomy may be performed if problems persist despite
          medication. If frequent tonsil infections occur, the tonsils may also
          be removed. The surgery involves:
          <ul>
            <li>General anesthesia</li>
            <li>Lasting under two hours</li>
            <li>
              Post-surgery care, including antibiotics and mild pain relievers
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Post-surgery symptoms may include a sore throat, minor bleeding,
        earaches, or a blocked nose, which usually resolve within a few weeks.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Long-Term Outlook</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Enlarged adenoids are common and very treatable. Early examination and
        treatment can prevent complications. In mild cases, simple antibiotics
        may suffice, while more severe cases may require surgery.
