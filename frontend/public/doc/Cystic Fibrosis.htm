      <h1 class="acne-page-title">Cystic Fibrosis</h1>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease characterized by an
        abnormality in the body's salt, water, and mucus-making cells. While it
        is a chronic, progressive disease, improved treatments have
        significantly extended life expectancy. Most people with CF live into
        their late 30s, and many even into their 50s or longer. Some CF patients
        now live into their 70s.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Children with CF have an abnormality in the function of a cell protein
        called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). CFTR controls
        the flow of water and certain salts in and out of the body's cells. As
        the movement of salt and water in and out of cells is altered, mucus
        becomes thickened. The thickened mucus can affect many organs and body
        systems including:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Respiratory. This includes sinuses and lungs.</li>
        <li>
          Digestive. This includes pancreas, liver, gallbladder, and intestines.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reproductive. Both men and women may experience reproductive problems.
        </li>
        <li>Sweat glands.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        About 30,000 people in the U.S. are affected with the disease. It occurs
        mainly in whites who have a northern European heredity, although it also
        occurs in Hispanics, African-Americans, Asian Americans, and American
        Indians.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        More than 10 million people in the U.S. are carriers of the cystic
        fibrosis gene. These people are not affected by the disease, and usually
        do not know that they are carriers.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Symptoms</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Many children today are diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (CF) before they
        have any symptoms. This is because of an increase in newborn screening
        programs. Before screening programs existed, most children with CF were
        diagnosed after one of the following:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Respiratory symptoms. Most commonly cough, wheezing, or breathing
          difficulty.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meconium ileus. A thick and sticky first bowel movement of a baby that
          can block the small intestine.
        </li>
        <li>Failure to thrive. Not gaining weight as normal after birth.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The following are the most common symptoms for CF. However, each child
        may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms also may depend on when
        your child is diagnosed.
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Salty tasting skin</li>
        <li>
          Chronic respiratory symptoms like wheezing, cough, and colored sputum
        </li>
        <li>Lung infections</li>
        <li>Poor growth</li>
        <li>Constipation</li>
        <li>Greasy and bulky stools</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Medical Problems</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        These are other medical problems that may occur in some children with
        CF:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Sinusitis or infection of the sinuses</li>
        <li>
          Nasal polyps or an abnormal growth out of the mucus membranes of the
          nose
        </li>
        <li>
          Clubbing of fingers and toes. This is a condition marked by the ends
          of the fingers and toes becoming enlarged. It occurs more often in the
          fingers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pneumothorax or collapsed lung. The presence of air or gas in the
          pleural cavity causes the lung to collapse.
        </li>
        <li>Hemoptysis, or coughing up blood</li>
        <li>
          Cor pulmonale. Right-sided heart failure from long-term high blood
          pressure in the lung arteries.
        </li>
        <li>Abdominal pain</li>
        <li>Gas in the intestines</li>
        <li>Rectal prolapse or a protruding of the rectum out of the anus</li>
        <li>Liver disease</li>
        <li>Diabetes</li>
        <li>
          Pancreatitis. This is an inflammation of the pancreas, an organ that
          creates many hormones and enzymes the body needs to function properly.
        </li>
        <li>Gallstones</li>
        <li>Congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens in males</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        As stated above, the symptoms of CF differ for each child. Infants born
        with CF usually show symptoms within the first year. Some children,
        though, may not show symptoms until later in life. The following
        symptoms may indicate CF, and infants having these signs may be tested
        for CF:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Diarrhea that doesn’t go away</li>
        <li>Foul-smelling stools</li>
        <li>Greasy stools</li>
        <li>Frequent episodes of wheezing</li>
        <li>Frequent episodes of pneumonia</li>
        <li>Persistent cough</li>
        <li>Skin tastes like salt</li>
        <li>Poor growth</li>
        <li>Chronic sinus infection</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The symptoms of CF may resemble other conditions or medical problems.
        Always consult your child’s doctor for a diagnosis.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Diagnosis</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        In addition to a complete medical history and physical exam, diagnostic
        procedures for cystic fibrosis (CF) may include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Sweat (chloride) test:</strong> A test to measure the amount
          of chloride in the sweat. The test is done by placing a solution on
          the forearm (or the thigh, if the child is too small) and attaching
          electrodes. The skin is stimulated to sweat with a mild electric
          current, which does not cause pain or harm to your child. The sweat is
          collected onto a gauze pad and analyzed. Higher than normal amounts of
          chloride may suggest CF. The sweat test is not painful and usually
          causes only minor discomfort.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Genetic tests:</strong> Blood or cells taken from a cheek
          scraping can be tested for mutations in the CFTR gene.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        As part of the doctor’s assessment of CF symptoms, your child may also
        have these diagnostic procedures:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Blood tests:</strong> Blood tests, including pancreatic
          function tests, can look at infection and to see which organs may be
          affected.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chest X-rays:</strong> A diagnostic test that uses invisible
          electromagnetic energy beams to produce images of internal tissues,
          bones, and organs onto film.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pulmonary function tests:</strong> Diagnostic tests that help
          to measure the lungs’ ability to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide
          appropriately. The tests are usually done with special machines that a
          child must breathe into.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sputum cultures:</strong> A diagnostic test done on the
          material that is coughed up from the lungs and into the mouth. A
          sputum culture is often done to find out if an infection is present.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stool evaluations:</strong> These are done to measure fat
          absorption.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Treatments</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Specific treatment for cystic fibrosis (CF) will be determined by your
        child's doctor based on:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Your child's age, overall health, and medical history</li>
        <li>Extent of the disease (body systems affected)</li>
        <li>
          Your child's tolerance for specific medications, procedures, or
          therapies
        </li>
        <li>Your opinion or preference</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        At the present time, there is no cure for CF. However, research in gene
        therapy is being done. The gene that causes CF has been identified, and
        this may lead to an increased understanding of the disease. Gene therapy
        research hopes to eventually cure, prevent, or slow progression of the
        disease. Goals of treatment are to ease the severity of symptoms and
        slow the progress of the disease.

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">
        Management of Problems That Cause Lung Obstruction
      </h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Chest physical therapy:</strong> This is to help loosen and
          clear lung secretions, which may include postural drainage, and
          devices, such as a percussor or flutter, which vibrate the chest wall
          and loosen secretions. Chest physical therapy can be done manually or
          mechanically, with a vest.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Exercise:</strong> This can help loosen mucus, stimulate
          coughing, and improve overall physical condition.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Medications:</strong> Such as bronchodilators and
          anti-inflammatories. These are used to decrease inflammation, reduce
          mucus, draw water into the lungs to loosen mucus, and help breathing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Antibiotics:</strong> These are used to treat lung infections.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Management of Digestive Problems</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Appropriate diet</li>
        <li>Pancreatic enzymes to aid digestion</li>
        <li>Vitamin supplements</li>
        <li>Treatments for intestinal obstructions</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Psychosocial Support</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Provides help in dealing with issues such as coping, independence,
        sterility, and sexuality, financial issues, and relationships.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        As lung disease progresses to end-stage, other medical options include
        lung transplantation. The type of transplant done is usually a double
        lung transplant, because leaving the other, sicker lung in place puts it
        at risk for infection and damage. Not everyone is a candidate for a lung
        transplant. Consult your child's doctor for more information.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        With medical and psychosocial support, many children and adolescents
        with CF can cope well and lead a productive life.
