      <h1>Cystic Fibrosis</h1>
      <p>
        Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease characterized by an
        abnormality in the body's salt, water- and mucus-making cells. While it
        is a chronic, progressive disease, improved treatments have
        significantly extended life expectancy. Most people with CF live into
        their late 30s, and many even into their 50s or longer. Some CF patients
        now live into their 70s.
      </p>

      <p>
        Children with CF have an abnormality in the function of a cell protein
        called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). CFTR controls
        the flow of water and certain salts in and out of the body's cells. As
        the movement of salt and water in and out of cells is altered, mucus
        becomes thickened. The thickened mucus can affect many organs and body
        systems including:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Respiratory.</b> This includes sinuses and lungs.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Digestive.</b> This includes pancreas, liver, gallbladder, and
          intestines.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Cystic Fibrosis</b></p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Reproductive.</b> Both men and women may experience reproductive
          problems.
        </li>
        <li><b>Sweat glands</b></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        About 30,000 people in the U.S. are affected with the disease. It occurs
        mainly in whites who have a northern European heredity, although it also
        occurs in Hispanics, African-Americans, Asian Americans, and American
        Indians.
      </p>

      <p>
        More than 10 million people in the U.S. are carriers of the cystic
        fibrosis gene. These people are not affected by the disease, and usually
        do not know that they are carriers.
      </p>

      <p><b>Symptoms</b></p>

      <p>
        Many children today are diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (CF) before they
        have any symptoms. This is because of an increase in newborn screening
        programs. Before screening programs existed, most children with CF were
        diagnosed after one of the following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Respiratory symptoms.</b> Most commonly cough, wheezing, or
          breathing difficulty.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Meconium ileus.</b> A thick and sticky first bowel movement of a
          baby that can block the small intestine.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Failure to thrive.</b> Not gaining weight as normal after birth.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The following are the most common symptoms for CF. However, each child
        may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms also may depend on when
        your child is diagnosed.
      </p>

      <p>Symptoms may include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Salty tasting skin</li>
        <li>
          Chronic respiratory symptoms like wheezing, cough, and colored sputum
        </li>
        <li>Lung infections</li>
        <li>Poor growth</li>
        <li>Constipation</li>
        <li>Greasy and bulky stools</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Other medical problems</b></p>

      <p>
        These are other medical problems that may occur in some children with
        CF:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Sinusitis or infection of the sinuses</li>
        <li>
          Nasal polyps or an abnormal growth out of the mucus membranes of the
          nose
        </li>
        <li>Clubbing of fingers and toes</li>
        <li>Pneumothorax or collapsed lung</li>
        <li>Hemoptysis, or coughing up blood</li>
        <li>
          Cor pulmonale. Right-sided heart failure from long-term high blood
          pressure in the lung arteries.
        </li>
        <li>Abdominal pain</li>
        <li>Gas in the intestines</li>
        <li>Rectal prolapse or a protruding of the rectum out of the anus</li>
        <li>Liver disease</li>
        <li>Diabetes</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Pancreatitis.</b> This is an inflammation of the pancreas, an organ
          that creates many hormones and enzymes the body needs to function
          properly.
        </li>
        <li><b>Gallstones</b></li>
        <li>
          <b>Congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens in males</b>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        As stated above, the symptoms of CF differ for each child. Infants born
        with CF usually show symptoms within the first year. Some children,
        though, may not show symptoms until later in life. The following
        symptoms may indicate CF, and infants having these signs may be tested
        for CF:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Diarrhea that doesn’t go away</li>
        <li>Foul-smelling stools</li>
        <li>Greasy stools</li>
        <li>Frequent episodes of wheezing</li>
        <li>Frequent episodes of pneumonia</li>
        <li>Persistent cough</li>
        <li>Skin tastes like salt</li>
        <li>Poor growth</li>
        <li>Chronic sinus infection</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The symptoms of CF may resemble other conditions or medical problems.
        Always consult your child’s doctor for a diagnosis.
      </p>

      <p><b>Diagnosis</b></p>

      <p>
        In addition to a complete medical history and physical exam, diagnostic
        procedures for cystic fibrosis (CF) may include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Sweat (chloride) test.</b> A test to measure the amount of chloride
          in the sweat.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Genetic tests.</b> Blood or cells taken from a cheek scraping can
          be tested for mutations in the CFTR gene.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        As part of the doctor’s assessment of CF symptoms, your child may also
        have these diagnostic procedures:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Blood tests.</b> Blood tests, including pancreatic function tests,
          can look at infection and see which organs may be affected.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Chest X-rays.</b> A diagnostic test that uses invisible
          electromagnetic energy beams to produce images of internal tissues,
          bones, and organs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Pulmonary function tests.</b> Diagnostic tests that help to measure
          the lungs' ability to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Sputum cultures.</b> A diagnostic test done on the material coughed
          up from the lungs. It helps to detect infections.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Stool evaluations.</b> These are done to measure fat absorption.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Treatments</b></p>

      <p>
        Specific treatment for cystic fibrosis (CF) will be determined by your
        child's doctor based on:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Your child's age, overall health, and medical history</li>
        <li>Extent of the disease (body systems affected)</li>
        <li>
          Your child's tolerance for specific medications, procedures, or
          therapies
        </li>
        <li>Your opinion or preference</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        At the present time, there is no cure for CF. However, research in gene
        therapy is being done. The gene that causes CF has been identified, and
        this may lead to an increased understanding of the disease. Gene therapy
        research hopes to eventually cure, prevent, or slow progression of the
        disease. Goals of treatment are to ease severity of symptoms and slow
        the progress of the disease.
      </p>

      <p>Treatment may include:</p>

      <p>
        <b
          >Management of problems that cause lung obstruction, which may
          involve:</b
        >
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Chest physical therapy.</b> This helps loosen and clear lung
          secretions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Exercise.</b> This can help loosen mucus, stimulate coughing, and
          improve physical condition.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Medications.</b> These include bronchodilators and
          anti-inflammatories.
        </li>
        <li><b>Antibiotics.</b> These are used to treat lung infections.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Management of digestive problems, which may involve:</b></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Appropriate diet</li>
        <li>Pancreatic enzymes to aid digestion</li>
        <li>Vitamin supplements</li>
        <li>Treatments for intestinal obstructions</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <b>Psychosocial support.</b> Provides help in coping with issues such as
        independence, sterility, financial issues, and relationships.
      </p>

      <p>
        As lung disease progresses to end stage, other medical options include
        lung transplantation. Not everyone is a candidate for a lung transplant.
        Consult your child's doctor for more information.
      </p>

      <p>
        With medical and psychosocial support, many children and adolescents
        with CF can cope well and lead a productive life.
