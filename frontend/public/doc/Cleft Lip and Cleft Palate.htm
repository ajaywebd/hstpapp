      <h1 class="acne-page-title">Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate</h1>
      <p class="acne-main-text acne-left-img">
        Cleft lip and cleft palate are birth abnormalities of the mouth and lip.
        In the United States, nearly 6,800 babies are born with oral clefts
        annually. These abnormalities occur less frequently among
        African-Americans. They arise early in pregnancy when the sides of the
        lip and the roof of the mouth do not fuse as they should. A child can
        have cleft lip, cleft palate, or both, with boys more commonly affected.
        Most babies born with a cleft are otherwise healthy with no additional
        abnormalities.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Cleft Palate</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Cleft palate occurs when the roof of the mouth does not completely
        close, leaving an opening that may extend into the nasal cavity. It can
        involve either side of the palate, extending from the front of the mouth
        (hard palate) to the throat (soft palate). Often, it includes the lip as
        well. Cleft palate is less noticeable than cleft lip because it is
        located inside the mouth. In some cases, cleft palate runs in families.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Cleft Lip</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Cleft lip occurs when the lip does not fully form during fetal
        development. It can range from mild (a small notch in the lip) to severe
        (a large opening extending to the nose). Cleft lip is categorized based
        on location and severity:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Unilateral incomplete: A cleft on one side of the lip that does not
          extend to the nose.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unilateral complete: A cleft on one side of the lip extending into the
          nose.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bilateral complete: A cleft involving both sides of the lip and the
          nose.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Causes</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The exact cause of cleft lip and palate is not fully understood. They
        result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors,
        described as "multifactorial inheritance." The risk of recurrence in a
        family depends on how many relatives have clefts. If both parents are
        unaffected but have one child with a cleft, the chance of having another
        affected child is 3-5%. Genetic consultation is recommended for families
        with a history of clefts.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Complications</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Feeding difficulties:</strong> Infants with cleft palate may
          struggle to suck properly due to the incomplete roof of the mouth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ear infections and hearing loss:</strong> Dysfunction of the
          tube connecting the middle ear and throat can lead to recurrent
          infections and potential hearing loss.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Speech and language delays:</strong> Muscle function may be
          reduced, causing delays or abnormalities in speech. Referral to a
          speech therapist is often recommended.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dental problems:</strong> Teeth may erupt abnormally, often
          requiring orthodontic care.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Feeding My Baby with Cleft Palate</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The most immediate concern for a baby with cleft palate is good
        nutrition. Sucking for children with a cleft palate is difficult because
        of the poorly formed roof of the mouth. Children with just a cleft lip
        (without a cleft palate) do not routinely have feeding difficulties.
        Below are some suggestions to help feed your infant:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Breastfeeding may take extra time and patience. If it's not providing
          adequate nutrition, consider alternatives like pumping breast milk and
          feeding through other techniques.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hold your infant in an upright position to prevent food from coming
          out of the nose.
        </li>
        <li>
          Consult your child’s doctor about suitable feeding devices for your
          baby.
        </li>
        <li>
          Offer small, frequent feedings to ensure your infant gets enough
          calories to gain weight.
        </li>
        <li>
          Consider specialized bottles and nipples, such as:
          <ul class="acne-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Dr. Brown's Specialty Feeding System®:</strong> Features a
              unidirectional flow valve for managing complex oral feeding
              issues.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cleft palate nurser® by Mead Johnson:</strong> A soft,
              squeezable plastic bottle with a large crosscut nipple.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Special Needs Bottle by Medela:</strong> Designed with a
              valve to control air intake and prevent milk backflow.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

        Treatment for Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate
      </h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Cleft lip and/or palate is typically corrected with surgery, though
        children may require additional services like dental or orthodontic care
        before surgery. The Cleft and Craniofacial team will work closely with
        you and your pediatrician to determine the best treatment plan for your
        child. Key treatment options include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Nasal Alveolar Molding:</strong> A technique used before
          surgery to shape the gums, lip, and nostrils.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Surgery for Cleft Lip:</strong> Performed within the first 3
          to 6 months of life, depending on the surgeon’s recommendations, to
          repair the separation of the lip.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Surgery for Cleft Palate:</strong> Typically done between 10
          to 12 months of age to fix the roof of the mouth, enabling normal
          eating and speech development.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Living with Cleft Lip or Cleft Palate</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Children with cleft lip or palate can live healthy, happy lives. While
        some may face challenges such as teasing or bullying, they can find
        support from parents, teachers, counselors, and their cleft palate team.
        Kids should be encouraged to embrace their unique qualities and seek
        help when needed to navigate social situations. With proper treatment
        and care, they can grow into confident, well-adjusted adults.
