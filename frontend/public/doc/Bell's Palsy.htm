        Bell's palsy is an unexplained episode of facial muscle weakness or
        facial paralysis that begins suddenly and worsens over three to five
        days. This condition results from damage to the 7th (facial) cranial
        nerve, and pain and discomfort usually occurs on one side of the face or
        head.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        It can strike anyone at any age, but it occurs most often in pregnant
        women, and people who have diabetes, influenza, a cold, or another upper
        respiratory ailment. According to the National Institute of Neurological
        Disorders and Stroke, this facial nerve disorder affects about 40,000
        U.S. adults and children each year. Bell's palsy strikes men and women
        equally. It is less common before age 15 or after age 60.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Bell's palsy is not considered permanent, but in rare cases, it does not
        disappear. Currently, there is no known cure for Bell's palsy; however,
        recovery usually begins two weeks to six months from the onset of the
        symptoms. The majority of people with Bell's palsy recover full facial
        strength and expression.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Causes</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        A specific cause of Bell's palsy is unknown; however, it has been
        suggested that the disorder is due to inflammation directed by the
        body's immune system against the nerve controlling movement of the face.
        The weakness or symptoms seen in Bell's palsy are sometimes associated
        with the following:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Diabetes</li>
        <li>High blood pressure</li>
        <li>Trauma</li>
        <li>Toxins</li>
        <li>Lyme disease</li>
        <li>Guillain-Barré syndrome</li>
        <li>Sarcoidosis</li>
        <li>Myasthenia gravis</li>
        <li>
          Infection, especially following a viral infection with Herpes simplex
          virus (commonly associated with cold sores).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Pathogenesis</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Idiopathic, congenital, traumatic, and neoplastic causes can all account
        for facial nerve palsy. Nearly half of these qualify as Bell's palsy and
        are believed to be a post-infectious, allergic, or immune neuritis
        affecting the facial nerve. There is no evidence of viral invasion of
        the nerve. Commonly associated viral illnesses include EBV, Mumps, and
        Herpesvirus. Bell's palsy is also a common neurologic manifestation of
        Lyme's disease.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Symptoms</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The following are the most common symptoms of Bell's palsy. However,
        each individual may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may
        include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Disordered movement of the muscles that control facial expressions,
          such as smiling, squinting, blinking, or closing the eyelid
        </li>
        <li>Loss of feeling in the face</li>
        <li>Headache</li>
        <li>Tearing</li>
        <li>Drooling</li>
        <li>
          Loss of the sense of taste on the front two-thirds of the tongue
        </li>
        <li>Hypersensitivity to sound in the affected ear</li>
        <li>Inability to close the eye on the affected side of the face</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Clinical Manifestations</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Physical manifestations may go unnoticed by parents and may have a
        sudden onset (within a period of hours). These include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Weakness of upper and lower face (forehead muscle sparing suggests an
          upper motor neuron lesion due to bilateral innervation)
        </li>
        <li>Inability to close the eye</li>
        <li>
          Unilateral drooping of the corner of the mouth, especially evident
          when smiling
        </li>
        <li>Loss of the nasolabial fold</li>
        <li>Normal sensation</li>
        <li>Possible loss of taste in the anterior two-thirds of the tongue</li>
        <li>
          Initial presentation of pain around the ear or surrounding areas
        </li>
        <li>May be associated with hyperacusis</li>
        <li>Prodrome of ear pain and dysacusis may be present</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Differential Diagnosis of Facial Weakness</h2>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Otitis media</li>
        <li>Mastoiditis</li>
        <li>Temporal bone abscess</li>
        <li>Trauma</li>
        <li>Iatrogenic surgical injury</li>
        <li>Intracranial lesions including tumors, AVMs, infarcts</li>
        <li>Nerve tumors</li>
        <li>Leukemic invasion of facial nerve, rhabdomyosarcomas</li>
        <li>Polio in endemic areas</li>
        <li>
          Hypertension. There have been reports of associated weakness with
          increased blood pressure that may be controlled when BP is controlled
          or may return intermittently.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Course</h2>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          85% of patients have complete recovery from weeks to months after
          onset.
        </li>
        <li>
          10% have mild residual weakness, and about 5% have severe residual
          facial weakness.
        </li>
        <li>
          Incomplete recovery is associated with total facial involvement. These
          patients should undergo electrophysiologic testing, and other
          etiologies should be considered.
        </li>
        <li>There is about a 7% recurrence rate.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Treatment</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        One uniformly recommended treatment for Bell's palsy is protecting the
        eye from drying at nighttime or while working at a computer. Eye care,
        which may include eye drops during the day, ointment at bedtime, or a
        moisture chamber at night, helps to protect the cornea from scratching,
        which is crucial to the management of Bell’s palsy.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Your doctor will establish an appropriate treatment protocol for your
        condition based on the severity of your symptoms and your medical
        profile. Other treatment options include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Steroid medications to reduce inflammation</li>
        <li>Antiviral medications, such as acyclovir</li>
        <li>Analgesics or moist heat to relieve pain</li>
        <li>Physical therapy to stimulate the facial nerve</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Alternative Therapies</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Some individuals may choose to use alternative therapies in the
        treatment of Bell's palsy, but there is no proof these alternative
        therapies actually make an absolute difference in a person's recovery.
        Such treatments may include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Relaxation</li>
        <li>Acupuncture</li>
        <li>Electrical stimulation</li>
        <li>Biofeedback training</li>
        <li>Vitamin therapy, including B12, B6, and the mineral Zinc</li>
      </ul>
