      <h1 class="acne-page-title">Chickenpox</h1>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Chickenpox, also called varicella, is characterized by itchy red
        blisters that appear all over the body. This condition is caused by a
        virus and often affects children. It was once so common it was
        considered a childhood rite of passage. Itâ€™s very rare to have the
        chickenpox infection more than once. Since the chickenpox vaccine was
        introduced in the mid-1990s, cases have significantly declined.
      </p>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Symptoms</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        An itchy rash is the most common symptom of chickenpox. The infection
        will be in your body for around seven to 21 days before the rash and
        other symptoms develop. You start to be contagious up to 48 hours before
        the skin rash starts to appear.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The non-rash symptoms may last a few days and include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Headache</li>
        <li>Loss of appetite</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        One or two days after experiencing these symptoms, the classic rash will
        begin to develop. The rash goes through three phases before recovery:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>You develop red or pink bumps all over your body.</li>
        <li>The bumps become blisters filled with fluid that leaks.</li>
        <li>The bumps become crusty, scab over, and begin to heal.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The bumps on your body will not all be in the same phase at the same
        time, as new bumps will continuously appear throughout your infection.
        The rash may be very itchy, especially before it scabs over with a
        crust. You are still contagious until all the blisters on your body have
        scabbed over. The crusty scabbed areas eventually fall off. It typically
        takes seven to 14 days for the rash to disappear completely.
      </p>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Causes</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Most cases
        occur through contact with an infected person. The virus is contagious
        to those around you for one to two days before blisters appear and
        remains contagious until all blisters have crusted over. The virus can
        spread through:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Saliva</li>
        <li>Coughing</li>
        <li>Sneezing</li>
        <li>Contact with fluid from the blisters</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Risk Factors</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Exposure to the virus through previous active infection or vaccination
        reduces risk. Immunity from the virus can also be passed on from a
        mother to her newborn, lasting about three months from birth.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Anyone who has not been exposed may contract the virus. Risk increases
        under any of these conditions:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Recent contact with an infected person</li>
        <li>Being under 12 years of age</li>
        <li>Being an adult living with children</li>
        <li>Spending time in a school or child care facility</li>
        <li>
          Having a compromised immune system due to illness or medications
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Diagnosis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        You should always call your doctor any time you develop an unexplained
        rash, especially if it's accompanied by cold symptoms or fever. One of
        several viruses or infections could be affecting you. Tell your doctor
        right away if you are pregnant and have been exposed to chickenpox. Your
        doctor may diagnose chickenpox based on a physical exam of blisters on
        you or your child's body. Alternatively, lab tests can confirm the cause
        of the blisters.
      </p>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Treatment</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Most people diagnosed with chickenpox will be advised to manage their
        symptoms while they wait for the virus to pass through their system.
        Parents will be told to keep children out of school and day care to
        prevent the spread of the virus. Infected adults will also need to stay
        home.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Your doctor may prescribe antihistamine medications or topical
        ointments, or you may purchase these over the counter to help relieve
        itching. You can also soothe itching skin by:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Taking lukewarm baths</li>
        <li>Applying unscented lotion</li>
        <li>Wearing lightweight, soft clothing</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Your doctor may prescribe antiviral drugs if you experience
        complications from the virus or are at risk for adverse effects. People
        at high risk are usually the young, older adults, or those with
        underlying medical issues. These antiviral drugs do not cure chickenpox
        but make the symptoms less severe by slowing down viral activity,
        allowing your body's immune system to heal faster.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Possible Complications</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">Call your doctor right away if:</p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>The rash spreads to your eyes.</li>
        <li>
          The rash is very red, tender, and warm (signs of a secondary bacterial
          infection).
        </li>
        <li>The rash is accompanied by dizziness or shortness of breath.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        When complications occur, they most often affect:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Infants</li>
        <li>Older adults</li>
        <li>People with weak immune systems</li>
        <li>Pregnant women</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        These groups may also contract VZV pneumonia or bacterial infections of
        the skin, joints, or bones. Women exposed during pregnancy may bear
        children with birth defects, including:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Poor growth</li>
        <li>Small head size</li>
        <li>Eye problems</li>
        <li>Intellectual disabilities</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Long-Term Outlook</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The body can resolve most cases of chickenpox on its own. People usually
        return to normal activities within one to two weeks of diagnosis.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Once chickenpox heals, most people become immune to the virus. It won't
        be reactivated because VZV typically stays dormant in the body of a
        healthy person. In rare cases, it may re-emerge to cause another episode
        of chickenpox.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        It is more common for shingles, a separate disorder also triggered by
        VZV, to occur later during adulthood. If a person's immune system is
        temporarily weakened, VZV may reactivate in the form of shingles. This
        usually occurs due to advanced age or having a debilitating illness.
      </p>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Prevention</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The chickenpox vaccine prevents chickenpox in 98 percent of people who
        receive the two recommended doses. Your child should get the shot
        between 12 and 15 months of age. Children receive a booster between 4
        and 6 years of age.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Older children and adults who haven't been vaccinated or exposed may
        receive catch-up doses of the vaccine. As chickenpox tends to be more
        severe in older adults, people who haven't been vaccinated may opt to
        get the shots later.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        People unable to receive the vaccine can try to avoid the virus by
        limiting contact with infected people. However, this can be difficult.
        Chickenpox cannot be identified by its blisters until it has already
        been contagious for several days.
