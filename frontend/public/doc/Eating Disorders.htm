      <h1 class="acne-page-title">Eating Disorders</h1>

      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Eating disorders in children and teens cause serious changes in eating
        habits that can lead to major, even life-threatening health problems.
        The three main types of eating disorders are:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Anorexia: A condition in which a child refuses to eat adequate
          calories out of an intense and irrational fear of becoming fat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bulimia: A condition in which a child grossly overeats (binging) and
          then purges the food by vomiting or using laxatives to prevent weight
          gain.
        </li>
        <li>
          Binge eating: A condition in which a child may gorge rapidly on food
          but without purging.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        In children and teens, eating disorders can overlap. For example, some
        children alternate between periods of anorexia and bulimia. Eating
        disorders typically develop during adolescence or early adulthood.
        However, they can start in childhood, too. Females are much more
        vulnerable. Only an estimated 5% to 15% of people with anorexia or
        bulimia are male. With binge eating, the number rises to 35% male.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Causes</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Doctors aren't certain what causes eating disorders. They suspect a
        combination of biological, behavioral, and social factors. For instance,
        young people may be influenced by cultural images that favor bodies too
        underweight to be healthy. Also, many children and teens with eating
        disorders struggle with one or more of the following problems:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Distress</li>
        <li>Fear of becoming overweight</li>
        <li>Feelings of helplessness</li>
        <li>Low self-esteem</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        To cope with these issues, children and teens may adopt harmful eating
        habits. In fact, eating disorders often go hand-in-hand with other
        psychiatric problems such as the following:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Anxiety disorders</li>
        <li>Depression</li>
        <li>Substance abuse</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Dangers of Eating Disorders</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Eating disorders in children and teens can lead to a host of serious
        physical problems and even death. If you spot any of the signs of the
        eating disorders listed below, call your child's doctor right away.
        Eating disorders are not overcome through sheer willpower. Your child
        will need treatment to help restore normal weight and eating habits.
        Treatment also addresses underlying psychological issues. Remember that
        the best results occur when eating disorders are treated at the earliest
        stages.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Anorexia in Children and Teens</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Children and teens with anorexia have a distorted body image. People
        with anorexia view themselves as heavy, even when they are dangerously
        skinny. They are obsessed with being thin and refuse to maintain even a
        minimally normal weight.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        According to the National Institute of Mental Health, roughly one out of
        every 25 girls and women will have anorexia in their lifetime. Most will
        deny that they have an eating disorder.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">Symptoms of anorexia include:</p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Anxiety, depression, perfectionism, or being highly self-critical
        </li>
        <li>Dieting even when one is thin or emaciated</li>
        <li>Excessive or compulsive exercising</li>
        <li>Intense fear of becoming fat, even though one is underweight</li>
        <li>Menstruation that becomes infrequent or stops</li>
        <li>
          Rapid weight loss, which the person may try to conceal with loose
          clothing
        </li>
        <li>
          Strange eating habits, such as avoiding meals, eating in secret,
          monitoring every bite of food, or eating only certain foods in small
          amounts
        </li>
        <li>Unusual interest in food</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Anorexia can lead to several serious health problems, including:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Damage to major organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys
        </li>
        <li>Irregular heartbeat</li>
        <li>
          Lowered blood pressure, pulse, body temperature, and breathing rates
        </li>
        <li>Sensitivity to cold</li>
        <li>Thinning of bones</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Anorexia is fatal in about one out of every 10 cases. The most common
        causes of death include cardiac arrest, electrolyte imbalance, and
        suicide.
      </p>
      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Treating Anorexia</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The first aim of treatment is to bring the young person back to normal
        weight and eating habits. Hospitalization, sometimes for weeks, may be
        necessary. In cases of extreme or life-threatening malnutrition, tube or
        intravenous feeding may be required.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Long-term treatment addresses psychological issues. Treatments include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Antidepressant medication</li>
        <li>Behavioral therapy</li>
        <li>Psychotherapy</li>
        <li>Support groups</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Bulimia in Children and Teens</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Like children and teens with anorexia, bulimic young people also fear
        weight gain and feel extremely unhappy with their bodies.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        They will repeatedly eat too much food in a short amount of time. Often
        the child or teen senses a loss of control. Feeling disgusted and
        ashamed after overeating, young people with bulimia try to prevent
        weight gain by inducing vomiting or using laxatives, diet pills,
        diuretics, or enemas. After purging the food, they feel relieved.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Doctors make a diagnosis of bulimia after a person has two or more
        episodes per week for at least three months.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        People with bulimia usually fluctuate within a normal weight range,
        although they may be overweight, too. As many as one out of every 25
        females will have bulimia in their lifetime.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">Symptoms of bulimia include:</p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Abusing drugs and alcohol</li>
        <li>Abusing laxatives and other treatments to prevent weight gain</li>
        <li>Anxiety</li>
        <li>Bingeing on large amounts of food</li>
        <li>Eating in secret or having unusual eating habits</li>
        <li>Excessive exercise</li>
        <li>Mood swings</li>
        <li>Overemphasis on physical appearance</li>
        <li>Regularly spending time in the bathroom after eating</li>
        <li>Sadness</li>
        <li>Scarring on knuckles from using fingers to induce vomiting</li>
        <li>Unusual interest in food</li>
        <li>Vomiting after eating</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Complications can be serious. Stomach acids from chronic vomiting can
        cause:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Damage to tooth enamel</li>
        <li>Inflammation of the esophagus</li>
        <li>Swelling of the salivary glands in the cheeks</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        In addition, bulimia can also lower blood levels of potassium. This can
        lead to dangerous, abnormal heart rhythms.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Treating Bulimia</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Treatment aims to break the binge-and-purge cycle. Treatments may
        include the following:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Antidepressant medication</li>
        <li>Behavior modification</li>
        <li>Individual, family, or group therapy</li>
        <li>Nutritional counseling</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Binge Eating in Children and Teens</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Binge eating is similar to bulimia. It includes chronic, out-of-control
        eating of large amounts in a short time, even to the point of
        discomfort. However, binge eaters do not purge the food through vomiting
        or other means. As a result, they tend to become overweight or obese.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Binge eaters may be struggling to handle their emotions. Anger, worry,
        stress, sadness, or boredom may trigger a binge. Often, binge eaters are
        upset about overeating and may become depressed.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The excess weight caused by binge eating puts your son or daughter at
        risk of these health problems:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Heart disease</li>
        <li>High blood pressure</li>
        <li>High cholesterol</li>
        <li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Treating Binge Eating</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">Treatments include the following:</p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Behavioral therapy</li>
        <li>Medications, including antidepressants</li>
        <li>Psychotherapy</li>
      </ul>
