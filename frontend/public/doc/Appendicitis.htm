      <h1 class="acne-page-title">Appendicitis</h1>
      <p class="acne-main-text acne-left-img">
        Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix. It may be acute or
        chronic. In the United States, appendicitis is the most common cause of
        abdominal pain resulting in surgery. About 5 percent of Americans will
        experience appendicitis at some point in their lives. Appendicitis can
        happen at any time, but it occurs most often between the ages of 10 and
        30. It's more common in males than in females. If left untreated,
        appendicitis may cause your appendix to burst and cause infection. This
        can be serious and sometimes fatal.

        Read on to learn more about symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment.
      </p>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Is it appendicitis or gas?</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Indigestion or other gas-related pain are common symptoms of
        appendicitis. In some cases, you may feel as though the gas is trapped
        and find that you're unable to expel it. If you're only experiencing
        mild gas-related discomfort, you can take an over-the-counter (OTC)
        heartburn medication and see if your symptoms fade.
        <p >Popular OTC options include:</p>
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>omeprazole (Prilosec)</li>
        <li>lansoprazole (Prevacid)</li>
        <li>ranitidine (Zantac)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        If your symptoms persist for more than a day or cause unbearable pain or
        discomfort, see your doctor right away. You should also see your doctor
        if you're experiencing any other unusual symptoms.
      </p>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Symptoms</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        If you have appendicitis, you may experience one or more of the
        following symptoms:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Pain around the bellybutton</li>
        <li>Lower right side abdominal pain</li>
        <li>Loss of appetite</li>
        <li>Nausea</li>
        <li>Vomiting</li>
        <li>Diarrhea</li>
        <li>Constipation</li>
        <li>Inability to pass gas</li>
        <li>Abdominal swelling</li>
        <li>Low-grade fever</li>
        <li>A sense that you might feel better after passing stool</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Appendicitis pain may start as mild cramping and often becomes more
        steady and severe over time. You may also feel a general pain become
        more targeted. Avoid taking laxatives or having an enema if you suspect
        appendicitis, as these may cause your appendix to burst. If you have
        tenderness on your right side along with any of these symptoms, see your
        doctor immediately.
      </p>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">
        Are the symptoms of appendicitis the same in teens?
      </h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Adolescents experience similar symptoms to adults, but they may begin
        differently. In teens, appendicitis can begin as a vague stomachache
        near the navel, progressing to the lower right side of the abdomen.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">
        After this pain has appeared, teens may:
      </h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Develop a fever</li>
        <li>Lose their appetite</li>
        <li>Feel nauseous</li>
        <li>Vomit</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        If experiencing these symptoms, see your doctor.
      </p>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Causes</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        In many cases, the cause of appendicitis is unknown. Doctors believe an
        obstruction in the appendix may cause appendicitis, either partial or
        complete.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Obstruction can be due to:</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Accumulation of fecal matter</li>
        <li>Enlarged lymphoid follicles</li>
        <li>Worms</li>
        <li>Trauma</li>
        <li>Tumors</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        When obstructed, bacteria multiply inside the appendix, forming pus and
        causing pressure, pain, and potential gangrene. A ruptured appendix can
        fill the abdomen with fecal matter, leading to peritonitis or abscess
        formation.
      </p>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Diagnosis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Diagnosis typically begins with a physical exam to check for tenderness
        in the lower right abdomen. Doctors may use tests like:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Urinalysis to rule out UTI or kidney stones</li>
        <li>Pelvic exams to check for reproductive issues</li>
        <li>Pregnancy tests to rule out ectopic pregnancy</li>
        <li>Abdominal imaging with X-ray, ultrasound, or CT scan</li>
        <li>Chest X-ray to rule out lower lobe pneumonia</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Treatment</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Treatment usually involves surgery to remove the appendix
        (appendectomy). In some cases, antibiotics and abscess drainage may
        precede surgery. Recovery varies based on the procedure type and
        complications.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Possible surgery types include:</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Laparoscopy for quicker recovery</li>
        <li>Open surgery for abscess or peritonitis</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Recovery Time</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Recovery after laparoscopic surgery is shorter, with patients leaving
        the hospital within a few days. Open surgery recovery may take longer,
        especially if there are complications. Painkillers and fiber-rich foods
        may help during recovery.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Foods high in fiber include:</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Split peas</li>
        <li>Lentils</li>
        <li>Black beans</li>
        <li>Lima beans</li>
        <li>Artichokes</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Appendicitis in Pregnancy</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        During pregnancy, acute appendicitis is the most common non- obstetric
        emergency requiring surgery. It occurs at the same rate in women who are
        and aren’t pregnant.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        When it does occur in pregnant women, it’s usually during the second or
        third trimester. Its symptoms can often be mistaken for routine
        discomfort associated with pregnancy, making diagnosis difficult.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Delayed diagnosis can increase your risk of complications, including
        fetal loss. Women who are pregnant also have a higher risk of
        perforation or rupture.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Treatment for women who are pregnant and have appendicitis is the same
        as for women who aren’t pregnant.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        During recovery, women who are pregnant will be monitored even more
        closely by their surgeon, primary doctor, and obstetrician.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        If laparoscopic surgery is done, the recovery process generally is
        similar for women who are and aren’t pregnant.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        If an open surgical procedure is needed, your recovery time may be
        longer. This is especially true if your abdominal muscles are cut during
        the procedure or if there’s peritonitis . In some cases, peritonitis may
        cause a fetal loss.
