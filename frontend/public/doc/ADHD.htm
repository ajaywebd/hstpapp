      <p class="acne-main-text">
        These symptoms may resemble other health or behavior problems. Many of
        these symptoms may occur in children and teens who do not have ADHD.
        However, the symptoms must greatly affect how the child functions at
        home and in school. Make sure your child sees a healthcare provider for
        an accurate diagnosis.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Diagnosis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        ADHD is a complex condition and can be difficult to diagnose. There is
        no single test for ADHD. Doctors diagnose ADHD in children and teens
        after discussing symptoms at length with the child, parents, and
        teachers and observing the child's behaviors. The doctor will also
        gather information about family history and consider all possible
        causes.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        To confirm a diagnosis of ADHD or learning differences, tests may be
        given to assess a child's neurological and psychological status. These
        evaluations are often done with input from parents and teachers and
        administered by experienced pediatricians or mental health
        professionals.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Treatment</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The most effective treatment for ADHD is often a combination of
        medication, psychological, and behavioral therapies. Close cooperation
        between therapists, doctors, teachers, and parents is essential for
        success.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Stimulants</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Stimulants are the most commonly prescribed medications for treating
        ADHD. These drugs often decrease hyperactivity and improve
        concentration. Common medications include Adderall, Focalin, Vyvanse,
        and Ritalin, among others.
