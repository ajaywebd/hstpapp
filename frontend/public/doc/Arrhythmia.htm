      <h1 class="acne-page-title">Arrhythmia</h1>
      <p class="acne-main-text acne-left-img">
        An arrhythmia is any change in the regular, even rhythm of the
        heartbeat. If your child has an arrhythmia, their heart might beat too
        fast or too slow, or it might skip a beat or have extra beats. An
        arrhythmia might result from a physical condition—such as a heart
        defect—or in response to outside factors, such as a fever, infection,
        and certain medications. Even crying and playing can briefly alter a
        child’s heart rate.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Most arrhythmias are harmless, but some can be serious and even
        life-threatening. If your child’s heart beats too fast (a condition
        known as tachycardia), or too slow (bradycardia), it might affect the
        heart’s ability to pump blood efficiently to the rest of the body.
        Irregular blood flow can damage organs, including the kidneys, liver,
        heart, and brain.
      </p>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">How does an arrhythmia occur?</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The pumping action of the heart is powered by an electrical pathway that
        runs through the nerves in the walls of the heart. With each heartbeat,
        an electrical signal is generated and travels from the top of the heart
        to the bottom.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The signal begins in a group of cells in the right atrium (the upper
        right chamber of the heart) called the sinoatrial node (SA node). From
        there, the signal travels through special pathways to stimulate the
        right and left atria, causing them to contract and send blood into the
        ventricles (the bottom chambers of the heart).
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The current continues through its circuit to another group of cells
        called the atrioventricular node (AV node), which is between the atria
        and the ventricles. From there, the electric current moves on to another
        pathway called the bundle of His, where the signal branches out to
        stimulate the right and left ventricles, causing them to contract and
        send blood to the lungs and the rest of the body.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        When the circuit is working properly, the heart beats at a regular,
        smooth pace. When something interrupts the circuit, the heartbeat can
        become irregular, and an arrhythmia occurs.
      </p>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Types of arrhythmias</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        There are many types of arrhythmias, which can be grouped into three
        general categories: supraventricular (atrial) arrhythmias, ventricular
        arrhythmias, and bradyarrhythmias.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">
        Atrial arrhythmias in children include:
      </h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Premature atrial contractions (PACs) – early beats that start in the
          atria
        </li>
        <li>
          Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) – a rapid, usually regular rhythm,
          starting from above the ventricles (SVT begins and ends suddenly)
        </li>
        <li>
          AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) — a rapid heart rate due to
          more than one pathway through the AV node
        </li>
        <li>
          Atrial fibrillation — a condition in which many impulses begin and
          spread through the atria, competing for a chance to travel through the
          AV node
        </li>
        <li>
          Atrial flutter — an arrhythmia caused by one or more rapid circuits in
          the atrium
        </li>
        <li>
          Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome — a condition in which an electrical
          signal may arrive at the ventricle too quickly due to an extra
          conduction pathway or a shortcut from the atria to the ventricles
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">
        Ventricular arrhythmias in children include:
      </h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) — early extra beats
          beginning in the ventricles. These occur when the electrical signal
          starts in the ventricles, causing them to contract before receiving
          signals from the atria.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach) — a life-threatening condition in
          which electrical signals start from the ventricles in a fast and
          irregular rate
        </li>
        <li>
          Ventricular fibrillation — an irregular, disorganized firing of
          impulses from the ventricles
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Bradyarrhythmias</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Sinus node dysfunction — a slow heart rhythm due to an abnormal SA
          node
        </li>
        <li>
          Heart block — a delay or complete block of the electrical impulse from
          the SA node to the ventricles
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Causes</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        An arrhythmia can occur as a result of internal factors, such as a
        disease of the heart muscle itself (cardiomyopathy) or from birth
        (congenital heart disease).
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">
        Other common causes of arrhythmia in children include:
      </h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Infections</li>
        <li>Chemical imbalances</li>
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Medications</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Symptoms</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text acne-left-img">
        Recognizing symptoms of an arrhythmia depends on the age and maturity of
        your child. Older children can tell you about feeling lightheaded or
        feeling their heart fluttering or "skipping beats." For infants and
        toddlers, you might notice changes such as paleness of the skin,
        irritability, and disinterest in eating.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">
        Some common symptoms of arrhythmias include:
      </h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Weakness</li>
        <li>Tiredness</li>
        <li>Palpitations</li>
        <li>Feeling lightheaded or dizzy</li>
        <li>Fainting or near fainting</li>
        <li>Paleness</li>
        <li>Chest pain</li>
        <li>A slow heartbeat</li>
        <li>A fast heartbeat</li>
        <li>Feeling pauses between heartbeats</li>
        <li>Sweating</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath</li>
        <li>Difficulty feeding (infants)</li>
        <li>Irritability in infants</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Diagnosis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The doctor will begin with a thorough history, including a review of
        symptoms, and a physical exam. They might order blood tests to rule out
        medications and infections as the cause of the arrhythmia. The doctor
        may perform an electrocardiogram (ECG) to check if the heartbeat is
        regular. A pediatric cardiologist, a doctor who specializes in
        children’s heart disorders, may also be consulted.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        If your child does not have symptoms of arrhythmia at the time of the
        ECG, the doctor might order a portable monitor to record your child’s
        heartbeat over days to months. Implantable monitors that can be worn for
        up to a year or more are also available.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">
        Other tests that might be needed, depending on your child’s situation,
        include:
      </h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Electrophysiology tests — A small, thin tube is inserted into a blood
          vessel in the leg or arm and advanced to the heart, allowing the
          doctor to locate the origin of the arrhythmia within the heart tissue.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tilt table test — Often used for children who faint frequently. It
          shows how heart rate and blood pressure respond to a change in
          position, from lying down to standing up.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Treatment</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Many arrhythmias in children are isolated occurrences and harmless,
        requiring no treatment. When treatment is necessary, it depends on the
        child’s age and the type and cause of the arrhythmia. Treatment options
        include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Medicine: Many arrhythmias respond to medicine alone, though medicines
          have side effects and need close monitoring.
        </li>
        <li>
          Radiofrequency ablation: A procedure involving cardiac
          catheterization, using radiofrequency energy to heat and destroy the
          area where the arrhythmia originates, commonly used for tachycardia.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cardioversion: A procedure in which an electrical shock is delivered
          to the heart to convert an irregular or fast rhythm to a normal
          rhythm.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implantable devices:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Pacemakers: Small devices placed under the skin that use
              electrical pulses to control abnormal heart rhythm.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD): Devices also placed
              under the skin that use electrical pulses or shocks to control
              life-threatening arrhythmias.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Surgery — Maze surgery can treat atrial fibrillation by making small
          cuts or burns in the atria to prevent the spread of disorganized
          signals.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Prognosis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Most arrhythmias in children are harmless and do not lead to significant
        health problems. Even serious arrhythmias can often be treated
        successfully. The outlook is generally positive, depending on any
        underlying heart disease.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Living With Arrhythmias</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        In many cases, arrhythmias in children are harmless. However, if
        arrhythmias occur outside of exercise and play, occur frequently, or
        last a long time — especially in combination with any of the symptoms
        listed above — you should take your child to a healthcare professional.
