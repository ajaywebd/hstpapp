        Blindness is the inability to see anything, even light. If you're
        partially blind, you have limited vision. For example, you may have
        blurry vision or the inability to distinguish the shapes of objects.
        Complete blindness means that you can't see at all and are in total
        darkness. Legal blindness refers to vision that's highly compromised.
        What a person with healthy eyes can see from 200 feet away, a legally
        blind person can see only from 20 feet away.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Seek medical attention right away if you suddenly lose the ability to
        see. Have someone bring you to the emergency room for treatment. Don't
        wait for your vision to return. Depending on the cause of your
        blindness, immediate treatment may increase your chances of restoring
        your vision. Treatment may involve surgery or medication.

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Symptoms</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        If you're completely blind, you can see nothing. If you're partially

      </ul>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Symptoms of Blindness in Infants</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Constant eye rubbing</li>
        <li>An extreme sensitivity to light</li>
        <li>Poor focusing</li>
        <li>Chronic eye redness</li>

        <li>A white instead of a black pupil</li>

          Poor visual tracking, or trouble following an object with their eyes
        </li>
        <li>Abnormal eye alignment or movement after 6 months of age</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Causes</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The following eye diseases and conditions can cause blindness:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Glaucoma</li>
        <li>Macular degeneration</li>
        <li>Cataracts</li>
        <li>Lazy eye</li>
        <li>Optic neuritis</li>
        <li>Retinitis pigmentosa</li>
        <li>Tumors affecting the retina or optic nerve</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Causes of Blindness in Infants</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Infections, such as pinkeye</li>
        <li>Blocked tear ducts</li>
        <li>Cataracts</li>
        <li>Strabismus, or crossed eyes</li>
        <li>Amblyopia, or a lazy eye</li>
        <li>Ptosis, or a droopy eyelid</li>
        <li>Congenital glaucoma</li>
        <li>Retinopathy of prematurity</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Diagnosis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        A thorough eye exam by an optometrist will help determine the cause of
        your blindness or partial loss of vision. Your eye doctor will
        administer a series of tests that measure clarity of vision, eye muscle
        function, and how your pupils react to light.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Diagnosing Blindness in Infants</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        A pediatrician will screen your baby for eye problems shortly after
        birth. At 6 months of age, you should have an eye doctor or pediatrician
        check your child again for visual acuity, focus, and eye alignment.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Treatment</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        In some cases of vision impairment, one or more of the following may
        help to restore your vision:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Eyeglasses</li>
        <li>Contact lenses</li>
        <li>Surgery</li>
        <li>Medication</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Adapting to Blindness</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Complete blindness requires learning new skills to approach life. These
        may include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Reading Braille</li>
        <li>Using a guide dog</li>
        <li>Memorizing the keypad on your phone</li>
        <li>Organizing your home for easy navigation</li>
        <li>Using tactile methods to distinguish money</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Prevention</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Regular eye examinations are key to detecting eye diseases and
        preventing vision loss. Early treatment for conditions such as glaucoma
        and cataracts can help prevent blindness and maintain healthy vision.
