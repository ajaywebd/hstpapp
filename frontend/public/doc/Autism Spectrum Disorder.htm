      <h1 class="acne-page-title">Autism Spectrum Disorder</h1>
      <p class="acne-main-text acne-left-img">
        Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental issue affecting a
        child’s nervous system, growth, and development, typically becoming
        apparent within the first three years of life. Children with ASD often
        appear detached, may lack social awareness, prefer routines, and have
        difficulties communicating or making eye contact.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        ASD can hinder social skills development, partly because children with
        ASD may not interpret facial expressions or emotions. Children with ASD
        may:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Not want to be touched</li>
        <li>Prefer solitary play</li>
        <li>Resist changes in routine</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Some children with ASD may excel in specific tasks like counting or
        remembering details and may show talents in areas like art or music.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Causes of ASD in a Child</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The exact causes of ASD are unknown. Genetic factors, brain structure
        irregularities, or chemical imbalances may contribute. ASD is not caused
        by parenting methods.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Less common causes:</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Exposure to toxins before or after birth</li>
        <li>Complications during delivery</li>
        <li>Infections before birth</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Risk Factors</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        ASD is more common in boys than girls, with genetic conditions like
        Fragile-X, PKU, neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, and chromosome
        issues raising the risk. Genetic testing by a medical geneticist can
        assess specific gene-related risks.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Symptoms</h2>

      <p>
        Each child may have slightly different symptoms. Below are the most
        common symptoms of ASD.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Social Symptoms</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Difficulty with eye contact</li>
        <li>Challenges in making friends or interacting with peers</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Communication Symptoms</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Poor communication skills</li>
        <li>Delayed speech or no speech</li>
        <li>Echolalia or repeating phrases from media</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Behavioral Symptoms</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Repetitive movements like rocking or flapping</li>
        <li>Increased or reduced sensitivity to sensory input</li>
        <li>Strict routines and rituals</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        ASD symptoms may resemble other conditions, so professional diagnosis is
        essential.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Diagnosis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        ASD is typically diagnosed before age 2 through well-child screenings
        and by monitoring certain developmental milestones:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>No babbling, pointing, or gesturing by 12 months</li>
        <li>No single words by 16 months</li>
        <li>No two-word phrases by 24 months, only repeating others' words</li>
        <li>Loss of language or social skills at any age</li>
        <li>Lack of eye contact by 3-4 months</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Additional tests for ASD may include nervous system exams, imaging
        tests, mental health assessments, and genetic testing.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Treatment</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Each child with ASD needs a customized treatment program, ideally
        started as early as possible with parental involvement.
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Behavior change programs:</strong> Focus on social, motor, and
          cognitive skills, and address behavior.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Special education programs:</strong> Develop social, speech,
          language, self-care, and vocational skills.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Medicine:</strong> Some children benefit from medications to
          manage symptoms.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        A mental health provider can also offer support to both the child and
        family, including counseling, social skills training, and one-on-one
        therapy.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Prevention</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Experts do not know how to prevent ASD, and it is unrelated to
        parenting. However, early diagnosis and treatment can significantly
        improve quality of life and developmental outcomes.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Living with Autism</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The primary care provider will be instrumental in managing ASD treatment
        and understanding care requirements. Parents play a critical role in
        supporting their child by:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Keeping all appointments with the child’s healthcare provider</li>
        <li>
          Collaborating with a care team that may include specialists like
          neurologists, therapists, and social workers
        </li>
        <li>
          Working with schools and healthcare providers to develop a treatment
          plan
        </li>
        <li>
          Seeking support from community services and connecting with other
          parents of children with ASD
        </li>
      </ul>
