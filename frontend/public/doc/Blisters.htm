        A blister is a circular-shaped bump on the skin containing bloody or
        clear fluid.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Causes</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Blisters are caused by injury, allergic reactions, or infections,
        including the following:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Burns/scalds</li>
        <li>Sunburns</li>
        <li>Friction (i.e., from a shoe)</li>
        <li>Contact dermatitis</li>
        <li>Impetigo (a contagious infection of the skin)</li>
        <li>Viral infections (including chickenpox and herpes zoster)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The symptoms of a blister may resemble other skin conditions or medical
        problems. Always consult a physician for the proper diagnosis.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Treatment</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Blisters often heal spontaneously. Treatment varies according to the
        cause. General guidelines for treatment include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Wash the area with soap and water</li>
        <li>Apply a cold or ice pack to reduce swelling and discomfort</li>
        <li>Keep the area clean and dry</li>
        <li>Do not burst or puncture the blister</li>
        <li>
          If the blister bursts, place an adhesive bandage or dressing on the
          area to keep it clean
        </li>
        <li>
          Watch the blister or burst area for signs of infection such as
          increased warmth, swelling, redness, drainage, pus formation, or pain.
        </li>
        <li>
          Call the physician if infection occurs, as antibiotics may be
          necessary.
        </li>
      </ul>
