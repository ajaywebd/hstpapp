      <h1>Crohn's Disease in Children</h1>

      <p>
        Crohn’s disease is a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) where one
        or more parts of a child’s intestinal tract become inflamed. Crohn’s
        disease is a chronic but highly manageable disease.
      </p>

      <p>
        While Crohn’s is more commonly diagnosed in young adults, it does affect
        children as well. Some important facts about Crohn’s in children and
        teens:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Symptoms may be mild or severe.</li>
        <li>
          Crohn’s often affects the small intestine, but can affect any part of
          the digestive tract, including the mouth, esophagus, stomach,
          duodenum, appendix, colon, or anus.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is no cure, however, the right treatment plan can minimize or
          eliminate symptoms with medication and lifestyle changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          The disease can go into long periods of remission (when symptoms go
          away) and then flare up again.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The disease can go into long periods of remission, for months to even
        years.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          It can affect any region of the digestive tract, including the mouth,
          esophagus, stomach, duodenum, appendix, colon, or anus. The most
          common area to be affected is the last part of the small intestine
          (terminal ileum).
        </li>
        <li>
          In rare cases, it starts with orofacial granulomatosis (OFG), a
          chronic inflammatory condition of the mouth highly associated with
          Crohn’s that often progresses to the bowel.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Signs and symptoms</h2>

      <p>
        While symptoms may affect each child differently, common symptoms
        include unexplained fevers and diarrhea with or without blood. A child
        may be losing weight and not growing as expected, since the pain may
        make them not want to eat, and inflammation may prevent the small
        intestine from absorbing the nutrients the body needs.
      </p>

      <p>Other symptoms may include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Abdominal pain, often in the lower right area</li>
        <li>Weakness</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>
          Rectal bleeding (although often associated with ulcerative colitis)
        </li>
        <li>Blood in the stools or black, tar-like stools</li>
        <li>Joint pain</li>
        <li>Rashes</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Some infections can cause symptoms like these, and it's important for
        these to be excluded as possible causes. Crohn’s can be a challenging
        disease for a child to have, and reassurance and support can go a long
        way toward making a child feel better.
      </p>

      <h2>What causes Crohn’s disease in children?</h2>

      <p>
        Scientists have not yet discovered the cause of Crohn’s disease, but
        it’s an area of active research. We believe that both genes and the
        environment play a role. We also know that the immune system is
        involved, which is why treatment often involves medication to reduce its
        activity.
      </p>

      <h2>Crohn’s disease diagnosis</h2>

      <p>
        There isn’t just one test to diagnose Crohn’s disease. Your child’s
        doctor will most likely recommend a combination of tests to diagnose
        Crohn’s disease, including:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Blood tests</li>
        <li>Stool sample tests</li>
        <li>Endoscopy</li>
        <li>Colonoscopy</li>
        <li>Biopsy</li>
        <li>Imaging studies</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>

      <p>
        For young people dealing with Crohn’s disease, it’s critical to find a
        treatment that lessens symptoms without causing harmful side effects.
        Some medications can be more dangerous for children specifically. For
        instance, infliximab (Remicade) is often used to treat Crohn’s disease
        in adults, but it has been found to cause hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma
        in some children, especially in those also taking certain other Crohn’s
        medications. This is a rare type of cancer that can be life-threatening.
        However, Remicade has recently been approved by the FDA to treat
        children with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease who haven’t responded
        well to other treatments. Your child’s doctor will help you weigh the
        risks and benefits of this or any other treatments.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are various medicines that can help your child without causing
        serious negative effects. Surgery is sometimes needed when medical
        treatments fail to control your child’s symptoms.
      </p>

      <h3>Common medical treatments</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Aminosalicylates (5-ASAs):</strong> These are a group of
        medicines that can reduce inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract.
        Since inflammation often triggers the onset of Crohn’s disease symptoms,
        5-ASAs can help prevent flare-ups. Side effects may include headaches,
        abdominal cramping, and gas. In rare cases, children taking 5-ASAs
        experience hair loss and skin rashes. The medications might also
        increase the risk of swelling around the heart, lungs, and pancreas.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Antibiotics:</strong> Another type of medication that may be
        used to treat children with Crohn’s disease. Common antibiotics for
        Crohn’s include metronidazole and ciprofloxacin. These medications work
        by suppressing inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, helping to
        reduce the recurrence of symptoms. Side effects include nausea,
        vomiting, loss of appetite, and headaches. In rare cases, tendonitis and
        rupture of tendons may occur.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Steroids:</strong> Corticosteroids may be prescribed, but
        they’re rarely the preferred option for long-term treatment due to side
        effects such as acne, weight gain, and mood swings. These side effects
        usually disappear when the doctor lowers the dosage or takes the child
        off corticosteroids.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Immunosuppressors:</strong> Medications such as azathioprine or
        6-mercaptopurine may be used to help reduce the use of corticosteroids.
        These medications may cause side effects such as nausea, fever, rash, or
        inflammation of the liver or pancreas. They may also reduce white blood
        cells and platelets, and increase the risk of lymphoma.
      </p>

      <h2>Treating Crohn's in children through nutrition</h2>

      <h3>Diet</h3>

      <p>
        If you’re wary of the potential side effects of medications, managing
        your child’s symptoms through diet and nutrition may be the best option.
        To help prevent flare-ups, avoid giving your child certain foods that
        may exacerbate symptoms, including spicy foods, beans, and possibly
        dairy products.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ensuring that your child has a well-balanced diet can help reduce
        symptoms. Make sure they’re eating enough lean protein, fruits, and
        vegetables. It’s also important for your child to eat foods containing
        soluble fiber, such as applesauce, blueberries, and oatmeal. Your child
        may also need to take calcium supplements if they have weak bones as a
        result of Crohn’s disease. Other vitamin and mineral supplements are
        often also recommended.
      </p>

      <h3>Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN)</h3>

      <p>
        Some families have successfully tried exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN),
        which involves the exclusive use of special liquid formulas that help
        fight inflammation. Many children have found the formulas unpalatable,
        so they often need to be administered through a feeding tube inserted
        through the nose, stomach, or rarely, a vein.
      </p>

      <p>
        While this is a safe method of combating the effects of Crohn’s disease,
        it can take a significant amount of time, making it inconvenient for
        many families. Talk to your child’s doctor to see if EEN may be a good
        choice for your family.
