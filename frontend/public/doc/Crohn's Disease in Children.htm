      <h1 class="acne-page-title">Crohn's Disease in Children</h1>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Crohn’s disease is a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) where one
        or more parts of a child’s intestinal tract become inflamed. Crohn’s
        disease is a chronic but highly manageable disease.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        While Crohn’s is more commonly diagnosed in young adults, it does affect
        children as well. Some important facts about Crohn’s in children and
        teens:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Symptoms may be mild or severe.</li>
        <li>
          Crohn’s often affects the small intestine, but can affect any part of
          the digestive tract, including the mouth, esophagus, stomach,
          duodenum, appendix, colon or anus.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is no cure, however, the right treatment plan can minimize or
          eliminate symptoms with medication and lifestyle changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          The disease can go into long periods of remission (when symptoms go
          away) and then flare up again.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The disease can go into long periods of remission, for months to even
        years. It can affect any region of the digestive tract, including the
        mouth, esophagus, stomach, duodenum, appendix, colon, or anus. The most
        common area to be affected is the last part of the small intestine
        (terminal ileum).
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        In rare cases, it starts with orofacial granulomatosis (OFG), a chronic
        inflammatory condition of the mouth highly associated with Crohn’s that
        often progresses to the bowel.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Signs and Symptoms</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        While symptoms may affect each child differently, common symptoms
        include unexplained fevers and diarrhea with or without blood. A child
        may be losing weight and not growing as expected, since the pain may
        make them not want to eat, and inflammation may prevent the small
        intestine from absorbing the nutrients the body needs.
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Abdominal pain, often in the lower right area</li>
        <li>Weakness</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>
          Rectal bleeding (although often associated with ulcerative colitis)
        </li>
        <li>Blood in the stools or black, tar-like stools</li>
        <li>Joint pain</li>
        <li>Rashes</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Some infections can cause symptoms like these, and it's important for
        these to be excluded as possible causes. Crohn’s can be a challenging
        disease for a child to have, and reassurance and support can go a long
        way toward making a child feel better.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">What Causes Crohn’s Disease in Children?</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Scientists have not yet discovered the cause of Crohn’s disease, but
        it’s an area of active research. We believe that both genes and the
        environment play a role. We also know that the immune system is
        involved, which is why treatment often involves medication to reduce its
        activity.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Crohn’s Disease Diagnosis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        There isn’t just one test to diagnose Crohn’s disease. Your child’s
        doctor will most likely recommend a combination of tests to diagnose
        Crohn’s disease, including:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Blood tests</li>
        <li>Stool sample tests</li>
        <li>Endoscopy</li>
        <li>Colonoscopy</li>
        <li>Biopsy</li>
        <li>Imaging studies</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Treatment</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        For young people dealing with Crohn’s disease, it’s critical to find a
        treatment that lessens symptoms without causing harmful side effects.
        Some medications can be more dangerous for children specifically. For
        instance, infliximab (Remicade) is often used to treat Crohn’s disease
        in adults.
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Infliximab may be effective in treating adults, but it has been found
          to cause hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in some children, especially in
          those also taking certain other Crohn’s medications. This is a rare
          type of cancer that can be life-threatening. However, Remicade has
          recently been approved by the FDA to treat children with moderate to
          severe Crohn’s disease who haven’t responded well to other treatments.
          Your child’s doctor will help you weigh the risks and benefits of this
          or any other treatments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Talk to your child’s doctor about which medications would be best for
          easing your child’s symptoms. There are various medicines that can
          help your child without causing serious negative effects. Surgery is
          sometimes needed when medical treatments fail to control your child’s
          symptoms.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title" style="border-bottom: none">
        Common Medical Treatments :
      </h2>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Aminosalicylates</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Some of the preferred medications for treating Crohn’s disease in
        children are aminosalicylates (5-ASAs). These are a group of medicines
        that can reduce inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Since
        inflammation often triggers the onset of Crohn’s disease symptoms,
        5-ASAs can help prevent flare-ups.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        However, these medications do have potential side effects, which include
        headaches, abdominal cramping, and gas. In rare cases, children taking
        5-ASAs experience hair loss and skin rashes. The medications might also
        increase the risk of swelling around the heart, lungs, and pancreas.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Antibiotics</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Antibiotics are another type of medication that may be used to treat
        children with Crohn’s disease. Common antibiotics for Crohn’s include
        metronidazole and ciprofloxacin, which are both prescribed in lighter
        doses for children. These medications work by suppressing inflammation
        in the gastrointestinal tract, helping to reduce the recurrence of
        symptoms.
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Metronidazole may cause nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. When
          used for an extended period, the medication can also cause a tingling
          sensation in the hands and feet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ciprofloxacin may cause headaches, rash, and diarrhea, and in rare
          cases may cause tendonitis and rupture of the tendons.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Steroids</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Steroids in the form of corticosteroids may also be prescribed for some
        children with Crohn’s disease. These medications can cause uncomfortable
        side effects, so they’re rarely the preferred option for long-term
        treatment.
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Acne</li>
        <li>Facial swelling</li>
        <li>Weight gain</li>
        <li>Unwelcome hair growth</li>
        <li>Mood swings</li>
        <li>Personality changes</li>
        <li>High blood pressure</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        These side effects usually disappear when the doctor lowers the dosage
        or takes the child off corticosteroids.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Immunosuppressors</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Immunosuppressors, or medications that suppress the immune system, such
        as azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine, may be used to help wean off or
        reduce the use of corticosteroids.
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Nausea</li>
        <li>A fever</li>
        <li>A rash</li>
        <li>Inflammation of the liver or pancreas</li>
        <li>A reduction in white blood cells and platelets in the blood</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Immunosuppressors may increase the risk of developing lymphoma.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">
        Treating Crohn's in Children Through Nutrition Diet
      </h2>

      <p class="acne-main-text">
        If you’re wary of the potential side effects of most medications,
        managing your child’s symptoms through diet and nutrition may be the
        best option. To help prevent flare-ups, you should avoid giving your
        child certain foods that may exacerbate symptoms, including spicy foods,
        beans, and possibly dairy products.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        While many cases of Crohn’s disease are too severe to be managed through
        diet alone, ensuring that your child has a well-balanced diet can help
        reduce symptoms. Make sure they’re eating enough lean protein, fruit,
        and vegetables. It’s also important for your child to eat foods
        containing soluble fiber, such as applesauce, blueberries, and oatmeal.
        Your child may also need to take calcium supplements if they have weak
        bones as a result of Crohn’s disease. Other vitamin and mineral
        supplements are often also recommended.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Exclusive Enteral Nutrition</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Some families have successfully tried exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN),
        which involves the exclusive use of special liquid formulas that help
        fight inflammation. Many children have found the formulas unpalatable,
        so they often need to be administered through a feeding tube inserted
        through the nose, stomach, or rarely, a vein.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        While this is a safe method of combating the effects of Crohn’s disease,
        it can take a significant amount of time, making it inconvenient for
        many families. Talk to your child’s doctor to see if EEN may be a good
        choice for your family.
