      <h1 class="acne-page-title">Congenital Heart Disease (CHD)</h1>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Congenital heart disease refers to a variety of structural heart
        abnormalities present at birth. It occurs when specific steps in heart
        development during pregnancy are disrupted. Affecting 1 in 120 babies in
        the U.S., CHD is the most common birth defect. Understanding these
        classifications helps parents and healthcare providers manage and treat
        these conditions effectively.

        Problems That Cause Too Much Blood to Pass Through the Lungs
      </h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        These defects allow oxygen-rich blood to re-circulate through the lungs,
        leading to increased lung pressure and congestion.
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA):</strong> An open passageway
          between the pulmonary artery and aorta fails to close after birth,
          leading to mixed blood flow.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Atrial Septal Defect (ASD):</strong> An abnormal opening
          between the right and left atria causes irregular blood flow.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD):</strong> A hole between the
          right and left ventricles allows oxygenated blood to flow back to the
          lungs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Atrioventricular Canal (AVC):</strong> A combination of ASD,
          VSD, and malformed heart valves.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">
        Problems That Cause Too Little Blood to Pass Through the Lungs
      </h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        These defects prevent enough oxygen-poor blood from reaching the lungs
        for oxygenation, resulting in cyanosis (blue skin).
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Tricuspid Atresia:</strong> Absence of the tricuspid valve
          prevents blood flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pulmonary Atresia:</strong> Malformation of the pulmonary
          valve restricts blood flow to the lungs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA):</strong> The
          pulmonary artery and aorta are reversed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF):</strong> A combination of four
          defects, including VSD and narrowed pulmonary valve.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Double Outlet Right Ventricle (DORV):</strong> Both the aorta
          and pulmonary artery arise from the right ventricle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Truncus Arteriosus:</strong> The aorta and pulmonary artery
          fail to separate properly, leaving a shared connection.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">
        Problems That Cause Too Little Blood to Travel to the Body
      </h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        These defects involve underdeveloped heart chambers or blockages in
        blood vessels, limiting blood supply to the body.
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Coarctation of the Aorta (CoA):</strong> Narrowing of the
          aorta restricts blood flow to the lower body and increases upper-body
          blood pressure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Aortic Stenosis (AS):</strong> Narrowing of the aortic valve
          hampers blood flow from the left ventricle to the body.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS):</strong>
          Underdevelopment of the left side of the heart prevents effective
          blood pumping.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Complex Congenital Heart Defects</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Some cases involve combinations of several defects, requiring
        specialized diagnosis and treatment plans tailored to the child's unique
        needs.
      </p>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Causes of Congenital Heart Disease</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Many congenital heart diseases have genetic causes, while others may
        involve environmental factors. Some known associations include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Chromosome abnormalities, such as Down syndrome, trisomy 18, trisomy
          13, and Turner's syndrome
        </li>
        <li>
          Microdeletion or microduplication syndromes, such as DiGeorge syndrome
        </li>
        <li>Single gene defects</li>
        <li>Environmental factors</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        If you have a congenital heart defect, it is advisable to speak with a
        genetic counselor or genetic specialist before becoming pregnant.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Symptoms of Congenital Heart Defects</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Symptoms of congenital heart defects in infants and children may
        include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Cyanosis (a bluish tint to the skin, fingernails, and lips)</li>
        <li>Respiratory distress</li>
        <li>Poor feeding</li>
        <li>Poor weight gain</li>
        <li>Recurrent lung infections</li>
        <li>
          Reduced ability to exercise or play actively compared to other
          children
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Testing and Diagnosis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Serious congenital heart diseases are often detected during pregnancy
        via routine ultrasound exams. Other conditions may be diagnosed shortly
        after birth or later in childhood when symptoms become apparent.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        If a physician suspects CHD during pregnancy, you may be referred to a
        pediatric cardiologist for further testing. Diagnostic tests can
        include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Fetal echocardiogram</li>
        <li>Electrocardiogram (EKG)</li>
        <li>Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</li>
        <li>Cardiac catheterization</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        At specialized centers, such as The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia,
        testing may be coordinated through programs like the Cardiac Center's
        Fetal Heart Program.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Treatments for Congenital Heart Disease</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Treatments for CHD vary based on the severity of the condition. Some
        heart problems may be managed with medications, while others require
        surgical intervention or cardiac catheterization.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Certain simpler conditions, like patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) or
        atrial septal defect (ASD), may resolve on their own as the child grows.
        However, more complex conditions often require multiple operations,
        catheter interventions, and ongoing care.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Outlook and Follow-Up Care</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Children with CHD are monitored by pediatric cardiologists who diagnose
        and manage their heart conditions before and after surgery. Surgical
        repairs are typically performed by pediatric cardiovascular or
        cardiothoracic surgeons.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        It is crucial for individuals born with CHD to transition to appropriate
        adult cardiac care as they age. Community adult cardiologists can manage
        simpler CHD cases, while specialized care is required for more complex
        conditions.
