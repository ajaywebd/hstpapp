      <h1 class="acne-page-title">Bronchitis and Bronchiolitis</h1>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Bronchitis is an inflammation of the lining of your bronchial tubes,
        which carry air to and from your lungs. People with bronchitis often
        cough up thickened mucus, which can be discolored. Bronchitis may be
        either acute or chronic.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Bronchiolitis is a common lung infection in young children and infants.
        It causes inflammation and congestion in the small airways (bronchioles)
        of the lungs. Bronchiolitis is almost always caused by a virus,
        typically peaking during the winter months.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Bronchiolitis starts with symptoms similar to a common cold but
        progresses to coughing, wheezing, and sometimes difficulty breathing.
        Symptoms can last for several days to weeks. Most children recover with
        home care, but some may require hospitalization.

        Symptoms of Bronchitis and Bronchiolitis
      </h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Bronchitis and bronchiolitis share common symptoms such as coughing,
        wheezing, and slight fever. However, there are unique symptoms for each
        condition.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Bronchitis Symptoms</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Cough</li>
        <li>Production of mucus</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath</li>
        <li>Slight fever</li>
        <li>Chills</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Chest discomfort or tightness</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Contact your doctor if your child's cough lasts more than three weeks or
        prevents them from sleeping. Call the doctor if the cough is accompanied
        by:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Wheezing</li>
        <li>Bright yellow or green mucus (indicating infection)</li>
        <li>Blood-tinged sputum</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Bronchiolitis Symptoms</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Dry, raspy cough</li>
        <li>Wheezing</li>
        <li>Difficulty feeding, especially in infants</li>
        <li>Slight fever</li>
        <li>Runny or stuffy nose</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Call your pediatrician if your child has the following symptoms:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Difficulty breathing</li>
        <li>Breathing rate of 50-60 breaths per minute</li>
        <li>Temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher</li>
        <li>Uncharacteristic tiredness or irritability</li>
        <li>No diaper change in 12 hours or more</li>
        <li>
          Eating less than half their typical amount during the last several
          meals
        </li>
        <li>Bluish color to the face</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Causes</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">Both conditions can be caused by viruses.</p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Acute bronchitis is often caused by viruses, especially the flu and the
        common cold. The most common cause of chronic bronchitis is smoking
        cigarettes or being around lung irritants.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Bronchiolitis is typically caused by a viral infection. The respiratory
        syncytial virus (RSV) is responsible for more than half of all cases of
        bronchiolitis. The common cold or flu can also cause the condition.
        Bronchitis can also have bacterial origins.
      </p>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Risk Factors</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Being around cigarette smoke and other lung irritants is a risk factor
        for both conditions.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">Risk factors specific to bronchitis include:</p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Gastric reflux, which can irritate your throat</li>
        <li>Regular exposure to irritants</li>
        <li>
          Low immune resistance, especially after a virus or primary infection
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        High-risk factors for developing bronchiolitis include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Babies born prematurely</li>
        <li>Babies with heart, lung, or immune conditions</li>
        <li>Children who spend time in day care</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Diagnosis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        When your doctor suspects bronchitis, they will listen to the lungs with
        a stethoscope and ask about other symptoms. If pneumonia is suspected,
        they may order a chest X-ray, which can also rule out other conditions
        like lung cancer.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">Additional tests may include:</p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Sputum tests to send to the lab for a culture</li>
        <li>
          A pulmonary function test to measure lung performance and breathing
          ability
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        If your doctor suspects that your child has bronchiolitis, they will
        listen to the lungs with a stethoscope, review the medical history, and
        note any symptoms. They may also:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Collect a mucus sample to check for viruses</li>
        <li>
          Run a blood test to check white blood cell count, which indicates
          infection
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Chest X-rays are rarely used to diagnose bronchiolitis unless
        complications are suspected.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Treatment</h2>
      <p>Treatments for bronchitis and bronchiolitis look very different.</p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Treatment for Bronchitis</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Antibiotics to treat bacterial infections</li>
        <li>Cough medicine, only for use at night to aid sleeping</li>
        <li>
          Medications such as steroids to reduce inflammation for conditions
          like asthma
        </li>
        <li>Medications by inhalation to help open the airways</li>
        <li>
          Pulmonary rehabilitation, which includes a breathing exercise program
          for chronic bronchitis
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Treatment for Bronchiolitis</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Helping your baby sleep with their head slightly raised by putting a
          pillow under the mattress
        </li>
        <li>Encouraging your child to drink as much fluid as possible</li>
        <li>Providing supplemental oxygen or IV fluids if hospitalized</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Outlook</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Bronchitis typically isn’t a cause for concern but may lead to
        complications like pneumonia. Recurrent cases could indicate chronic
        obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), requiring prompt treatment.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Many cases of bronchiolitis are minor and can be treated at home.
        However, untreated severe bronchiolitis can cause recurrent wheezing and
        reduced quality of life into teenage years. The condition may also be
        fatal if not treated.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Most children recover at home within three to five days. If
        hospitalized, recovery may take up to a week.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Prevention</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">To prevent both conditions:</p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Avoid cigarette smoke and other environmental irritants</li>
        <li>Practice good hygiene by washing hands regularly</li>
        <li>Wipe down children’s toys regularly</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        For bronchitis prevention, getting vaccinated with the annual flu
        vaccine can help reduce the risk, as post-flu infections cause many
        cases of bronchitis.
