        Children’s National Health System has a team of individuals who are
        highly skilled and experienced in the treatment of bone tumors,
        including osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma. Children’s patients have
        access to the most current therapies in treating pediatric cancer
        through Children’s Oncology Group’s protocols and other clinical trials.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        In addition, the Patient and Family Support Program Cancer and Blood
        Disorders provides comprehensive mental health and psychosocial services
        and helpful resources for all patients treated in the Center for Cancer
        Blood Disorders, as well as patients’ parents and siblings.

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Ewing Sarcoma</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Ewing sarcoma is a cancer that occurs primarily in the bone or soft
        tissue. It most often affects children between 5 and 20 years old and
        accounts for about 1.8% of childhood cancers. Symptoms include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Pain around the tumor site</li>
        <li>Swelling and redness around the site</li>
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Weight loss and decreased appetite</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Paralysis or incontinence if near the spine</li>
        <li>Nerve compression symptoms like numbness or tingling</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Causes for Ewing Sarcoma</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Ewing sarcoma is often linked to a chromosome rearrangement between
        chromosomes #11 and #22. This causes a gene fusion referred to as a
        fusion transcript. Trauma at the tumor site may bring the condition to
        attention but is not considered a cause.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Diagnosis</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">Diagnosis may include:</p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>X-rays</li>
        <li>Bone scans</li>
        <li>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</li>
        <li>CT scans</li>
        <li>Blood tests</li>
        <li>Biopsy of the tumor</li>
        <li>Bone marrow aspiration</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Osteogenic Sarcoma</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Also known as osteosarcoma, this is the most common type of bone cancer
        in children, often occurring between 10 and 25 years of age. Symptoms
        include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Pain at the tumor site</li>
        <li>Swelling and redness</li>
        <li>Increased pain with activity</li>
        <li>Limping</li>
        <li>Decreased movement of the affected limb</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Causes for Osteogenic Sarcoma</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">Causes may include:</p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Repeated trauma to the bone</li>
        <li>Genetic factors (e.g., retinoblastoma, Paget's disease)</li>
        <li>Exposure to ionizing radiation</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Ewing Sarcoma Diagnosis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        In addition to a complete medical history and physical examination of
        your child, diagnostic procedures for Ewing sarcoma may include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>X-rays:</strong> Use invisible electromagnetic energy beams to
          produce images of internal tissues, bones, and organs onto film. This
          test is used to measure and evaluate the curve.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bone scans:</strong> A nuclear imaging method that evaluates
          any degenerative and/or arthritic changes in the joints, detects bone
          diseases and tumors, determines the cause of bone pain or
          inflammation, and rules out infections or fractures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):</strong> Uses large magnets,
          radiofrequencies, and a computer to produce detailed images of organs
          and structures within the body. This test helps rule out associated
          abnormalities of the spinal cord and nerves.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Computer-assisted tomography scan (CT or CAT scan):</strong>
          Combines x-rays and computer technology to produce cross-sectional
          images (slices) of the body, including bones, muscles, fat, and
          organs. CT scans are more detailed than general x-rays.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Complete blood count (CBC):</strong> Measures the size,
          number, and maturity of different blood cells in a specific volume of
          blood.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Blood tests:</strong> Including blood chemistries to assess
          overall health.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Biopsy of the tumor:</strong> A procedure to examine the
          tumor's internal structure for abnormalities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy:</strong> Involves taking
          a small amount of bone marrow fluid or solid tissue to examine for the
          number, size, and maturity of blood cells and/or abnormal cells.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Treatment</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The specialists at Children’s National Health System aim not only to
        cure the cancer but also to minimize the side effects of treatment.
        Specific treatment for a bone tumor will be determined based on:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>The child’s age, overall health, and medical history</li>
        <li>The type, location, and size of the tumor</li>
        <li>The extent of the disease</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">Treatment options may include:</p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Surgery</li>
        <li>Cyberknife therapy</li>
        <li>Radiation therapy</li>
        <li>Amputation</li>
        <li>
          Resections for metastases, such as pulmonary resections of cancer
          cells in the lung
        </li>
        <li>
          Rehabilitation including physical and occupational therapy, and
          psychosocial adaptation
        </li>
        <li>Prosthesis fitting and training</li>
        <li>Antibiotics to prevent and treat infections</li>
        <li>
          Continual follow-up care to determine response to treatment, detect
          recurrent disease, and manage late effects of treatment
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Long-term Outlook</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The prognosis and long-term survival of children with Ewing sarcoma or
        osteosarcoma depend on various factors:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>The child’s age</li>
        <li>The extent of the disease (presence or absence of metastasis)</li>
        <li>Size and location of the tumor</li>
        <li>Tumor’s response to therapy</li>
        <li>
          The child’s tolerance of specific medications, procedures, or
          therapies
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Every child is unique, and treatment and prognosis are tailored to their
        needs. Prompt medical attention and aggressive therapy are essential for
        the best prognosis. Continuous follow-up care is crucial to manage late
        effects of radiation and chemotherapy, as well as to monitor for second
        malignancies. Researchers continue to discover new methods to improve
        treatment outcomes and reduce side effects.
