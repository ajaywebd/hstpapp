      <h1 class="acne-page-title">Ebola</h1>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Ebola is a serious and deadly virus transmitted by animals and humans.
        It was initially detected in 1976 in Sudan and the Democratic Republic
        of Congo. Researchers named the disease after the Ebola River. Until
        recently, Ebola appeared in Africa only.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Although the Ebola virus has been present for more than 35 years, the
        largest outbreak began in West Africa in March 2014. This outbreak has
        proven more deadly, severe, and widespread than previous outbreaks.
        While cases have significantly declined since the peak of the outbreak,
        there's still a chance of further outbreaks. Learning the facts about
        the virus can help prevent the spread of this deadly infection.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Causes</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The Ebola virus belongs to the viral family Filoviridae. Scientists also
        call it Filovirus. These virus types cause hemorrhagic fever or profuse
        bleeding inside and outside the body. It’s accompanied by a very high
        fever. Ebola can be further divided into subtypes that are named for the
        location where they were identified. These include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Bundibugyo</li>
        <li>Reston</li>
        <li>Sudan</li>
        <li>Taï Forest (previously known as Ivory Coast)</li>
        <li>Zaire</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The Ebola virus likely originated in African fruit bats. The virus is
        known as a zoonotic virus because it's transmitted to humans from
        animals. Humans can also transfer the virus to each other. The following
        animals can transmit the virus:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Chimpanzees</li>
        <li>Forest antelopes</li>
        <li>Gorillas</li>
        <li>Monkeys</li>
        <li>Porcupines</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Since people may handle these infected animals, the virus can be
        transmitted via the animal's blood and body fluids.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Risk Factors</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Unlike other types of viruses, Ebola can’t be transmitted through the
        air or by touch alone. You must have direct contact with the bodily
        fluids of someone who has it. The virus may be transmitted through:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Blood</li>
        <li>Diarrhea</li>
        <li>Breast milk</li>
        <li>Feces</li>
        <li>Saliva</li>
        <li>Semen</li>
        <li>Sweat</li>
        <li>Urine</li>
        <li>Vomit</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        These bodily fluids can all carry the Ebola virus. Transmission can
        occur via the eyes, nose, mouth, broken skin, or sexual contact.
        Healthcare workers are especially at risk for contracting Ebola because
        they often deal with blood and bodily fluids.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">Other risk factors include:</p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Exposure to infected objects, such as needles</li>
        <li>Interactions with infected animals</li>
        <li>Attending burial ceremonies of someone who has died from Ebola</li>
        <li>Traveling to areas where a recent outbreak has occurred</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Symptoms</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Ebola
        symptoms typically appear within 8 to 10 days after exposure; however,
        symptoms can appear as early as two days after exposure or take as long
        as three weeks to appear.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Extreme fatigue is often the first and most prominent symptom. Other
        symptoms include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Diarrhea</li>
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Headache</li>
        <li>Muscle pain</li>
        <li>Stomach pain</li>
        <li>Unexplained bleeding or bruising</li>
        <li>Vomiting</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        If you've come in contact with or provided care to someone diagnosed
        with Ebola or handled infected animals and have any symptoms, you should
        seek immediate medical attention.
      </p>
      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Diagnosis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The early symptoms of Ebola can closely mimic other diseases like the
        flu, malaria, and typhoid fever. Blood tests can identify antibodies of
        the Ebola virus. These may also reveal:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Either unusually low or high white blood cell counts</li>
        <li>Low platelet counts</li>
        <li>Elevated liver enzymes</li>
        <li>Abnormal coagulation factor levels</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        In addition to blood tests, a doctor will also consider whether others
        in the patient's community could be at risk. Since Ebola may occur
        within three weeks of exposure, anyone with possible exposure might
        undergo an incubation period of the same timeframe. If no symptoms
        appear within 21 days, Ebola is ruled out.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Treatment</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The Ebola virus does not have a cure or vaccine at this time. Instead,
        measures are taken to keep the person as comfortable as possible.
        Supportive care measures may include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Giving medications to maintain blood pressure</li>
        <li>Managing electrolyte balances</li>
        <li>Providing extra oxygen, if needed</li>
        <li>Providing intravenous and/or oral fluids to prevent dehydration</li>
        <li>Treating coexisting infections</li>
        <li>Preventing other infections from occurring</li>
        <li>Administering blood products if indicated</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Prevention</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Individuals can take several precautions to protect against Ebola. These
        steps include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Avoiding contact with blood and body fluids</li>
        <li>
          Practicing careful hand hygiene, including washing hands with soap and
          water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer
        </li>
        <li>
          Refraining from engaging in burial rituals that involve handling the
          body of a person who died from Ebola
        </li>
        <li>Wearing protective clothing around wildlife</li>
        <li>
          Refraining from handling items a person with Ebola has handled (this
          includes clothing, bedding, needles, or medical equipment)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Healthcare workers and lab technicians must also practice precautions.
        This includes isolating people with Ebola and wearing protective gowns,
        gloves, masks, and eye shields when coming into contact with the
        infected person or their belongings. Cleaning crews should use a bleach
        solution to clean surfaces that may have come into contact with the
        Ebola virus.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Further research is being done to help prevent future outbreaks. As of
        April 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) was involved in ongoing
        efforts.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Complications</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        People's immune systems can respond differently to Ebola. While some may
        recover from the virus without complication, others can have residual
        effects. These lingering effects may include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Joint problems</li>
        <li>Hair loss</li>
        <li>Extreme weakness and fatigue</li>
        <li>Delirium</li>
        <li>Inflammation of the liver and eyes</li>
        <li>Sensory changes</li>
        <li>Jaundice</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        According to the Mayo Clinic, such complications can last for a few
        weeks to several months. Other complications of the virus can be deadly,
        including:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Failure of multiple organs</li>
        <li>Coma</li>
        <li>Shock</li>
        <li>Severe bleeding</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Outlook</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        According to the WHO, the average fatality rate for a person infected
        with Ebola is 50 percent. Some virus strains are deadlier than others.
        The earlier the infection is diagnosed, the better the outlook for
        infected patients.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The CDC estimates that Ebola survivors have antibodies to the virus for
        about 10 years. This means that once you have the virus, you aren’t
        necessarily immune to getting an infection. Until a vaccine is
        available, it’s important to be on your guard to avoid the spread of
        Ebola.
