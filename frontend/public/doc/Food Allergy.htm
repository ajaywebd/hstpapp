      <h1>Food Allergies</h1>

      <h2>What is a food allergy?</h2>
      <p>
        A food allergy occurs when the immune system mistakenly treats a certain
        food as dangerous. Antibodies to the allergen trigger the release of
        chemicals like histamine, which can cause symptoms that affect various
        parts of the body.
      </p>

      <h2>What's a reaction like?</h2>
      <p>
        For example, in a peanut allergy, antibodies react to peanuts, causing
        symptoms such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tightness in the throat</li>
        <li>Hoarse voice</li>
        <li>Wheezing</li>
        <li>Cough</li>
        <li>Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea</li>
        <li>Hives or tingling in the lips or tongue</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In severe cases, a food allergy can cause <strong>anaphylaxis</strong>,
        a life-threatening condition where the body’s systems react all at once,
        potentially causing blood pressure drops, airway constriction, and
        swelling of the tongue.
      </p>

      <h2>How do you know if you have one?</h2>
      <p>
        It can be difficult to determine, as food allergies may be hard to
        identify when multiple ingredients are involved. Doctors may conduct
        allergy tests or review family history, as food allergies can be
        hereditary. They may also run diagnostic tests such as a skin test using
        extracts of food allergens to see how the body reacts.
      </p>

      <h2>What will the doctor do?</h2>
      <p>
        If a doctor suspects a food allergy, you will be referred to an
        allergist, who will ask about reactions and family history. The
        allergist may conduct a skin or liquid extract test to confirm
        allergies.
      </p>

      <h2>How do food allergies get diagnosed?</h2>
      <p>
        If you think you may have a food allergy, it's important to tell a
        parent and get a doctor’s evaluation. The allergist will ask about your
        reactions, family history, and symptoms. Diagnosis often involves a
        <strong>skin test</strong> where the doctor will apply a small amount of
        different food extracts to check for reactions like redness or swelling.
        They may also perform a <strong>blood test</strong> to check for
        specific antibodies.
      </p>

      <h2>How are food allergies treated?</h2>
      <p>
        There is no cure for food allergies, but there are ways to manage them:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Avoidance</strong>: The most effective way to handle a food
          allergy is by avoiding the trigger food.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Emergency Plan</strong>: It’s important to have a plan in case
          of accidental exposure. This plan often includes carrying
          <strong>epinephrine</strong> (an adrenaline shot) for severe reactions
          like anaphylaxis.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Antihistamines</strong>: These can help manage mild symptoms,
          though they aren’t a substitute for epinephrine in severe cases.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Living with food allergies</h2>
      <p>
        Living with food allergies means being cautious, but it doesn’t have to
        slow you down. Many companies now make allergen-free substitutes for
        favourite foods, making it easier to manage.
