      <!-- <h3 class="acne-sub-title">What is a Food Allergy?</h3> -->
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        A food allergy occurs when the immune system mistakenly treats a certain
        food as dangerous. Antibodies to the allergen trigger the release of
        chemicals like histamine, causing symptoms that affect various parts of
        the body.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">What's a Reaction Like?</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        For example, in a peanut allergy, antibodies react to peanuts, causing
        symptoms such as:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Tightness in the throat</li>
        <li>Hoarse voice</li>
        <li>Wheezing</li>
        <li>Cough</li>
        <li>Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea</li>
        <li>Hives or tingling in the lips or tongue</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        In severe cases, a food allergy can cause anaphylaxis, a
        life-threatening condition where multiple body systems react at once,
        potentially leading to blood pressure drops, airway constriction, and
        swelling of the tongue.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">How Do You Know If You Have One?</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Identifying a food allergy can be difficult, especially when multiple
        ingredients are involved. Doctors may conduct allergy tests, review
        family history, or perform diagnostic tests like skin testing with
        extracts of food allergens to observe the body’s reaction.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">What Will the Doctor Do?</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        If a doctor suspects a food allergy, they may refer you to an allergist.
        The allergist will ask about your reactions and family history, and may
        perform skin or blood tests to confirm allergies.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">How Are Food Allergies Diagnosed?</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        To diagnose a food allergy, the allergist may use:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Skin Tests: Small amounts of food extracts are applied to the skin to
          check for redness or swelling.
        </li>
        <li>
          Blood Tests: Measures specific antibodies to identify potential food
          allergens.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">How Are Food Allergies Treated?</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        There is no cure for food allergies, but they can be managed through:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Avoidance:</strong> Avoid trigger foods to prevent reactions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Emergency Plan:</strong> Carry epinephrine (an adrenaline
          shot) for severe reactions like anaphylaxis.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Antihistamines:</strong> Used for mild symptoms, but they
          cannot replace epinephrine for severe cases.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">Living With Food Allergies</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Living with food allergies requires caution but doesn’t have to limit
        your lifestyle. Many companies now offer allergen-free substitutes for
        favorite foods, making management easier.
