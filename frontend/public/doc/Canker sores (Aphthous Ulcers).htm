      <h1 class="acne-page-title">Canker Sores (Aphthous Ulcers)</h1>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Canker sores (aphthous ulcers) are small sores inside the mouth. They
        are often found inside the lips, on the cheeks, or on the tongue.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Causes</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The exact cause is not known, but many factors are thought to be
        involved with the development of canker sores. These include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Weakened immune system</li>
        <li>
          Allergies to food, such as coffee, chocolate, cheese, nuts, and citrus
          fruits
        </li>
        <li>Stress</li>
        <li>Viruses and bacteria</li>
        <li>Injury to the mouth</li>
        <li>Poor nutrition</li>
        <li>Certain medicines</li>
        <li>Irritation from orthodontic braces</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Canker sores are usually first seen in children and teens between the
        ages of 10 and 19. For about 3 in 10 children affected, canker sores
        reoccur for years after the first outbreak. They are not contagious.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Canker sores that keep coming back may be related to conditions such as
        celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or HIV infection.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Symptoms</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Each child may experience symptoms differently. The most common symptoms
        of aphthous stomatitis include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Painful sores in the mouth, usually inside the lips, on the cheeks, or
          on the tongue
        </li>
        <li>Sores covered with a yellow layer and having a red base</li>
        <li>Trouble eating or talking because of the sores</li>
        <li>No fever in most cases</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Canker sores usually heal in 7 to 14 days but tend to recur.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Diagnosis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Your child’s healthcare provider can usually diagnose canker sores with
        a complete health history and physical exam. Additional tests may be
        performed to rule out other causes, including:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Blood tests</li>
        <li>Cultures of the sores</li>
        <li>
          Biopsy of the sore, where a small tissue sample is examined under a
          microscope
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Treatment</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Treatment depends on your child’s symptoms, age, and overall health. It
        also considers the severity of the condition. The goal of treatment is
        to ease symptoms and may include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Drinking more fluids</li>
        <li>Taking acetaminophen for any fever or pain</li>
        <li>Maintaining proper oral hygiene</li>
        <li>Using topical medicines to ease pain</li>
        <li>Using mouth rinses to help with the pain</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Avoiding spicy, salty, or acidic foods can also help reduce mouth
        irritation and improve comfort.
