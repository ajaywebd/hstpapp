  <p class="acne-main-text">
    Cold sores are tiny fluid-filled blisters that appear on the edge of your lip. For adults, they can be uncomfortable and embarrassing, but for newborns, the virus causing them can be dangerous. The blisters form in clusters, often accompanied by tingling or burning sensations before they erupt.
  </p>
  <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Symptoms</h2>
  <p class="acne-main-text">
    Cold sores may cause a tingling or burning sensation days before blisters develop. Once formed, the red, fluid-filled blisters are painful and tender. They remain for up to two weeks and are contagious until they crust over. Additional symptoms may include:
  </p>
  <ul class="acne-list">
    <li>Fever</li>
    <li>Muscle aches</li>
    <li>Swollen lymph nodes</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="acne-main-text">
    Contact your doctor immediately if you develop eye symptoms during an outbreak, as untreated infections can cause permanent vision loss.
  </p>
  <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Stages of a Cold Sore</h2>
  <ul class="acne-list">
    <li>Stage 1: Tingling and itching occur about 24 hours before blisters erupt.</li>
    <li>Stage 2: Fluid-filled blisters appear.</li>
    <li>Stage 3: Blisters burst, ooze, and form painful sores.</li>
    <li>Stage 4: Sores dry out, scab over, and may cause itching and cracking.</li>
    <li>Stage 5: The scab falls off, and the cold sore heals.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="acne-section-title">Causes</h3>
  <p class="acne-main-text">
    Cold sores are caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). There are two strains:
    <ul class="acne-list">
      <li><strong>HSV-1:</strong> Commonly causes cold sores around the mouth.</li>
      <li><strong>HSV-2:</strong> Typically causes sores on the genitals but can also cause oral sores.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h3 class="acne-section-title">How Is It Spread?</h3>
  <p class="acne-main-text">
    HSV is highly contagious and spreads through skin-to-skin contact. Common transmission methods include kissing, sharing razors or towels, and oral sex. A person can spread the virus even without visible symptoms, but it is most contagious during an outbreak.
  </p>
  <h3 class="acne-section-title">Common Triggers</h3>
  <ul class="acne-list">
    <li>Illness or fever</li>
    <li>Stress</li>
    <li>Menstruation</li>
    <li>Pregnancy</li>
    <li>Sun exposure</li>
    <li>Injury</li>
    <li>Fatigue</li>
    <li>Immune deficiencies</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="acne-main-text">
    Pregnant women with herpes should inform their doctor, as the virus can be transmitted to the baby during pregnancy or childbirth. Active genital sores at delivery often require a cesarean section.
  </p>
  <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Risk Factors</h2>
  <p class="acne-main-text">
    Infants, especially in their first three to four weeks of life, are at the highest risk of severe symptoms from the herpes virus. This can lead to brain infections causing seizures, fever, irritability, poor feeding, and lethargy. Neonatal herpes affects 1 in every 3,500 babies born in the United States, often appearing in the first month. In severe cases, the infection can impact vital organs and may be life-threatening. Fortunately, older infants and children usually experience milder symptoms.
  </p>
  <ul class="acne-list">
    <li>Severe brain infections in newborns</li>
    <li>Blisters on the tongue, throat, and cheeks in older children</li>
    <li>Potential eye infections if a sore is touched and then rubbed into the eyes</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="acne-main-text">
    Dr. Spence emphasizes that any fever, blisters, or irritability in a baby exposed to cold sores warrants immediate medical attention.
  </p>
  <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Treatment</h2>
  <p class="acne-main-text">
    Cold sores typically resolve on their own in one to two weeks, but antiviral medications can speed up healing and reduce symptoms. Babies at risk for complications often require antiviral treatments in a hospital setting.
  </p>
  <h3 class="acne-section-title">Medications</h3>
  <ul class="acne-list">
    <li><strong>Pill forms:</strong> Acyclovir (Zovirax), Valacyclovir (Valtrex), Famciclovir (Famvir)</li>
    <li><strong>Ointments:</strong> Penciclovir (Denavir), Docosanol (Abreva)</li>
    <li>Over-the-counter creams with lidocaine or benzocaine for pain relief</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="acne-section-title">At-Home Treatments</h3>
  <ul class="acne-list">
    <li>Applying a cold compress</li>
    <li>Taking acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain relief</li>
    <li>Protecting lips from sun exposure</li>
    <li>Using over-the-counter creams for symptom management</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Protect Your Child</h2>
  <p class="acne-main-text">
    Parents and caregivers can take precautions to minimize a baby's exposure to cold sores:
  </p>
  <ul class="acne-list">
    <li>Use separate utensils, towels, and washcloths for the baby.</li>
    <li>Wash hands thoroughly after touching a cold sore.</li>
    <li>Keep the sore covered and avoid kissing the baby.</li>
    <li>Teach children not to rub their eyes or kiss others while they have a sore.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Complications</h2>
  <p class="acne-main-text">
    Though rare, complications from herpes simplex can occur, especially in children with eczema or weakened immune systems. Watch for these signs and contact a doctor immediately:
  </p>
  <ul class="acne-list">
    <li>High or persistent fever</li>
    <li>Difficulty breathing or swallowing</li>
    <li>Red, irritated eyes with or without discharge</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="acne-main-text">
    Timely medical intervention and proper precautions can help manage symptoms and prevent serious complications.
