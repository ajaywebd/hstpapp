      <h1 class="acne-page-title">Down Syndrome</h1>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Down syndrome is a genetic disorder. It is also called trisomy 21. It
        includes certain birth defects, learning problems, and facial features.
        A child with Down syndrome also may have heart defects and problems with
        vision and hearing. How severe or mild these problems are varies from
        child to child.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Down syndrome is one of the most common genetic birth defects. It
        affects about 1 in 800 babies. Adults with Down syndrome may live about
        60 years, but this can vary.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Causes</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        When a baby is conceived, a normal egg cell and normal sperm cell start
        with 46 chromosomes. The egg and sperm cells then divide in half, each
        having 23 chromosomes. When a sperm with 23 chromosomes fertilizes an
        egg with 23 chromosomes, the baby will have a complete set of 46
        chromosomes.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Sometimes an error occurs, and an egg or sperm cell may keep both copies
        of chromosome 21, instead of just 1 copy. This causes trisomy 21. In
        rare cases, an extra number 21 chromosome is attached to another
        chromosome, causing translocation Down syndrome. Mosaic trisomy 21
        occurs when the error happens after fertilization, resulting in some
        normal and some abnormal cells.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Risk Factors</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        A mother’s age at her child’s birth is the primary factor linked to the
        risk of having a baby with Down syndrome. This risk increases with age,
        especially after 35. However, most babies with Down syndrome are born to
        women younger than 35 due to higher birth rates in this group.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Symptoms</h2>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Eyes that slant upward</li>
        <li>Small ears that may fold over slightly at the top</li>
        <li>Small mouth that makes the tongue appear large</li>
        <li>Small nose with a flattened bridge</li>
        <li>Short neck</li>
        <li>Small hands with short fingers</li>
        <li>
          Two palm creases, including one across the palm and one around the
          thumb base
        </li>
        <li>Short height</li>
        <li>Loose joints</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Additional issues may include heart defects, intestinal problems, vision
        and hearing problems, thyroid disorders, and learning difficulties.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Diagnosis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Chromosome problems such as Down syndrome can often be diagnosed before
        birth through tests like amniocentesis, placental analysis, or
        noninvasive prenatal screening of the mother’s blood. Ultrasound may
        suggest Down syndrome but is not 100% accurate.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        After birth, a physical exam and blood sample to check for the extra
        chromosome can confirm the diagnosis.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Treatment</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        There is no cure for Down syndrome, but treatments can address
        associated health problems:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Heart defects:</strong> About half of babies with Down
          syndrome have heart defects, some requiring surgery. An echocardiogram
          is recommended within the first 2 months of life.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Intestinal problems:</strong> Some require surgery to correct
          structural issues.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Vision problems:</strong> Crossed eyes, nearsightedness, and
          cataracts can be treated with glasses, surgery, or other
          interventions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hearing loss:</strong> Regular hearing tests and treatments
          for fluid buildup or nerve defects are essential.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Other health concerns:</strong> These include thyroid
          problems, leukemia, and frequent respiratory infections.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Learning problems:</strong> Early intervention and special
          education can help children achieve developmental milestones.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Additional Notes</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        While some claim high-dose vitamins can improve learning and
        development, no studies have proven this effective. Regular medical
        care, supportive therapies, and early interventions are key to managing
        Down syndrome effectively.
      </p>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Complications</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Complications of Down syndrome vary depending on the affected body organ
        and the severity of the problem. Issues include birth defects, learning
        problems, and facial features. A child with Down syndrome may also have
        heart defects and problems with vision and hearing. Treatment will vary
        depending on the body organ affected and the severity of the problem.
        Your child’s healthcare provider will discuss treatment options with
        you.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Prevention</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Researchers don’t know how to prevent the chromosome errors that cause
        this disorder. There is no evidence that a parent can do anything to
        cause or prevent Down syndrome in their child.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        For women who have had one child with Down syndrome, the chance of
        having another baby with Down syndrome depends on several factors. Age
        is one key factor. While the risk increases after age 35, most babies
        with Down syndrome are born to women younger than 35 because they have
        more babies overall.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Living with Down Syndrome</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Children with Down syndrome can usually do most things that any young
        child can do, such as walking, talking, dressing themselves, and being
        toilet trained. However, they often reach these milestones later than
        other children. The timing of these developmental achievements varies
        from child to child.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Early intervention programs starting in infancy can help children with
        Down syndrome reach their potential. These programs, combined with
        special education, can enable children to attend school, learn to read
        and write, and take part in community activities. Many children can join
        regular classrooms with additional support.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Your child may benefit from physical, occupational, and speech therapy
        to aid their development. Support from healthcare providers, other
        families, and national Down syndrome organizations can provide valuable
        resources and guidance.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Special work programs exist for adults with Down syndrome, and many can
        hold regular jobs. More adults with the condition are living
        semi-independently in community group homes, where they care for
        themselves, engage in household tasks, develop friendships, and
        contribute to their communities.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Some people with Down syndrome marry. Most men with Down syndrome cannot
        father a child. Women with Down syndrome have a 1 in 2 chance of
        conceiving a child with Down syndrome, though many pregnancies result in
        miscarriage.

      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Down syndrome (trisomy 21) is a genetic disorder that includes birth
          defects, learning problems, and distinct facial features. It may also
          involve heart defects and vision or hearing issues.
        </li>
        <li>
          A mother’s age at the child’s birth is the main factor linked to the
          risk of having a baby with Down syndrome, with higher risk after age
          35.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is no known way to prevent the chromosome errors that cause Down
          syndrome.
        </li>
        <li>
          Down syndrome can often be diagnosed before birth through prenatal
          testing. After birth, diagnosis can be confirmed with a physical exam
          and a blood test.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is no cure, but treatment options such as therapy and education
          programs can help children with Down syndrome develop and thrive.
