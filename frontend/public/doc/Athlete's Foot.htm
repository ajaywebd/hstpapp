      <h1 class="acne-page-title">Athlete's Foot</h1>
      <p class="acne-main-text acne-left-img">
        Athlete's foot — also called tinea pedis — is a contagious fungal
        infection that affects the skin on the feet. It can also spread to the
        toenails and hands. Named for its prevalence among athletes, athlete's
        foot isn't serious but can be difficult to cure. Those with diabetes or
        a weakened immune system should consult a doctor if they suspect they
        have athlete's foot.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Causes</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Athlete's foot occurs when the tinea fungus grows on the feet. The
        fungus spreads through direct contact with an infected person or by
        touching contaminated surfaces. Thriving in warm, moist environments, it
        is commonly found in showers, locker rooms, and around swimming pools.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Risk Factors</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Certain behaviors increase the risk of athlete’s foot, including:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Visiting public places barefoot, like locker rooms, showers, and
          swimming pools
        </li>
        <li>Sharing socks, shoes, or towels with an infected person</li>
        <li>Wearing tight-fitting, closed-toe shoes</li>
        <li>Keeping feet wet for extended periods</li>
        <li>Having sweaty feet</li>
        <li>Having minor skin or nail injuries on the foot</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Symptoms</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">Possible symptoms of athlete's foot include:</p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Itching, stinging, and burning between the toes or on the soles</li>
        <li>Blisters on the feet that itch</li>
        <li>
          Cracking and peeling skin on the feet, commonly between the toes and
          on the soles
        </li>
        <li>Dry skin on the soles or sides of the feet</li>
        <li>Raw skin on the feet</li>
        <li>Discolored, thick, and crumbly toenails</li>
        <li>Toenails that pull away from the nail bed</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Diagnosis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        A doctor can diagnose athlete's foot based on symptoms or by ordering a
        skin test if unsure. The most common test, a skin lesion potassium
        hydroxide (KOH) exam, involves scraping a small area of infected skin,
        which is then placed in KOH to reveal fungal cells under a microscope.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Treatment</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Athlete’s foot is often treated with over-the-counter (OTC) topical
        antifungal medications. If these don’t work, a doctor may prescribe
        stronger medications or recommend home treatments to aid recovery.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">OTC Medications</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Miconazole (Desenex)</li>
        <li>Terbinafine (Lamisil AT)</li>
        <li>Clotrimazole (Lotrimin AF)</li>
        <li>Butenafine (Lotrimin Ultra)</li>
        <li>Tolnaftate (Tinactin)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Prescription Medications</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Prescription-strength topical clotrimazole or miconazole</li>
        <li>
          Oral antifungal medications like itraconazole (Sporanox), fluconazole
          (Diflucan), or terbinafine (Lamisil)
        </li>
        <li>Topical steroids for reducing painful inflammation</li>
        <li>
          Oral antibiotics for bacterial infections due to raw skin and blisters
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Complications</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Athlete’s foot can sometimes lead to complications, including an
        allergic reaction to the fungus causing blistering, or secondary
        bacterial infections. Severe bacterial infections may lead to swollen,
        painful, and warm feet, with symptoms such as pus, drainage, and fever.
        In rare cases, bacterial infections may spread to the lymphatic system,
        causing lymphangitis or lymphadenitis.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Prevention</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">Tips for preventing athlete’s foot include:</p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Wash your feet daily with soap and water, drying them thoroughly,
          especially between the toes.
        </li>
        <li>Use antifungal powder on your feet each day.</li>
        <li>Avoid sharing socks, shoes, or towels with others.</li>
        <li>
          Wear sandals in public showers, around pools, and other public places.
        </li>
        <li>
          Choose socks made of breathable fibers like cotton, wool, or
          moisture-wicking synthetics.
        </li>
        <li>Change socks when feet become sweaty.</li>
        <li>Air out your feet at home by going barefoot when possible.</li>
        <li>Wear shoes made from breathable materials.</li>
        <li>
          Alternate between two pairs of shoes to allow drying time between
          uses, as moisture can foster fungal growth.
        </li>
      </ul>
