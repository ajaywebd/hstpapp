      <h2>What is albinism?</h2>
      <p>
        Albinism is an inherited disease characterized by a substantially lower
        rate of melanin production.
      </p>
      <p>
        Melanin is the pigment responsible for the color of the skin, hair, and
        eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, but not always, people with albinism have lighter-colored
        skin and hair than the other members of their family or ethnic group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless of skin or hair tone, people with albinism always have some
        level of dysfunction with their vision.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because melanin normally protects the skin from UV (ultraviolet) damage,
        people with the disorder are more sensitive to sun exposure and have an
        increased risk of skin cancer.
      </p>
      <h2>Symptoms</h2>
      <p>
        The primary symptoms of albinism can be split into the following four
        categories:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Skin</b>: the most obvious symptom of albinism is a lighter skin
        tone. However, skin tone does not always differ substantially. Levels of
        melanin may slowly increase in some individuals, slowly darkening their
        skin tone as they age.
      </p>
      <p>
        After exposure to the sun, some people with albinism might develop
        freckles, moles (generally pink in color due to the reduced quantities
        of pigment), and large freckle-like spots called lentigines.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Hair</b>: as with skin, the hair can range in color from white to
        brown. Those of African or Asian descent tend to have yellow, brown, or
        reddish hair.
      </p>
      <p>As the individual ages, their hair color may slowly darken.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Eye color</b>: this can also change with age and varies from very
        light blue to brown. Low levels of melanin in the iris may cause the
        eyes to appear somewhat translucent, and, in certain light, look red or
        pink as the light reflects off the retina at the back of the eye.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lack of pigment prevents the iris from fully blocking sunlight; this
        makes people with albinism sensitive to light (photosensitive).
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Vision</b>: vision is always affected by albinism. Changes to eye
        function can include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Nystagmus - eyes move rapidly and uncontrollably back and forth</li>
        <li>Strabismus - the eyes do not function in unison</li>
        <li>Amblyopia - also referred to as a "lazy eye"</li>
        <li>Extreme nearsightedness or farsightedness</li>
        <li>Photophobia</li>
        <li>Optic nerve hypoplasia - underdeveloped optic nerve</li>
        <li>
          Optic nerve misrouting - nerve signals from the retina to the brain
          follow unusual nerve routes
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Astigmatism</b> - abnormal inflexibility of the front surface of the
        eye or lens causing blurred vision.
      </p>
      <h2>Causes</h2>
      <p>
        Albinism is caused by a mutation in one of several genes. The genes in
        question are responsible for various aspects of the production of
        melanin by melanocytes in the skin and eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most commonly, the mutations interfere with the enzyme tyrosinase
        (tyrosine 3-monooxygenase) which synthesizes melanin from the amino acid
        tyrosine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on the mutation, melanin production can either be slowed or
        completely stopped. But, regardless of the amount of interference with
        melanin production, there are always associated problems with the visual
        system in albinism.
      </p>
      <p>
        These vision problems occur because of melanin's vital role in the
        development of the retina and the optic nerve pathways from the eye to
        the brain.
      </p>
      <h2>Types</h2>
      <p>
        Albinism is split into a number of subgroups depending on the specific
        genes that are affected. These subgroups include the following:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>X-linked ocular albinism</b>: caused by a gene mutation of the X
        chromosome, X-linked ocular albinism occurs predominantly in males.
        Vision problems are present, but eye, hair, and skin color is generally
        in the normal range.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome</b>: this rare variant is most common in
        Puerto Rico. The symptoms are similar to oculocutaneous albinism but
        patients are more likely to develop bowel, heart, kidney, and lung
        diseases or bleeding disorders, such as hemophilia.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Chediak-Higashi syndrome</b>: a rare form of albinism, caused by a
        mutation in the CHS1/LYST genes. Symptoms are similar to oculocutaneous
        albinism but hair can appear silvery and skin can look slightly gray.
        These individuals also have defects in their white blood cells, making
        infections more common.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA)</b>: caused by a mutation in 1 of 4
        genes, OCA is further split into seven types depending on the mutations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>OCA type 1</b>: individuals tend to have milky skin, white hair, and
        blue eyes. With age, some individuals' skin and hair may darken.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>OCA type 2</b>: similar to type 1 and occurs most often in
        sub-Saharan Africans, African-Americans, and Native Americans.
      </p>
      <p><b>OCA type 3</b>: occurs mostly in black South Africans.</p>
      <p><b>OCA type 4</b>: occurs most often in East Asian populations.</p>
      <h2>Inheritance</h2>
      <p>
        Most types of albinism are inherited in an autosomal recessive
        inheritance pattern, the exception being X-linked ocular albinism which
        is passed on in an X-linked inheritance pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        Autosomal recessive inheritance: with autosomal recessive inheritance,
        an individual must receive faulty copies of a gene from the mother and
        father to develop albinism.
      </p>
      <p>
        If both parents carry the gene, there is a 1 in 4 chance that their
        offspring will have albinism and a 1 in 2 chance that the offspring will
        become a carrier (without symptoms).
      </p>
      <p>
        An estimated 1 in 70 people carry the genes associated with albinism but
        are not affected by the mutations.
      </p>
      <p>
        X-linked inheritance: X-linked recessive conditions predominantly affect
        males.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because females carry two X chromosomes, if one gene is damaged, the
        other can often make up the shortfall.
      </p>
      <p>Females can still carry and pass on the gene.</p>
      <p>
        Men, however, have one X and one Y chromosome, so any albino mutations
        in their singular X chromosome will generate the condition.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the mother has an X-linked mutation, each daughter will have a 1 in 2
        chance of becoming a carrier and each son will have a 1 in 2 chance of
        developing albinism.
      </p>
      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
      <p>The process of diagnosing albinism most often involves:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Physical exam</li>
        <li>Discussion about skin and hair pigmentation changes</li>
        <li>Examination of the eyes by an expert (ophthalmologist)</li>
        <li>Comparing the individual's coloration to family members</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Other diseases can also cause changes in pigmentation, but they will not
        cause changes in vision; if pigment changes and vision changes are both
        present, albinism is very likely to be the cause.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most reliable way to diagnose albinism is with genetic testing.
        However, if there is a history of albinism within the family, this is
        not always deemed necessary.
      </p>
      <h2>Treatment</h2>
      <p>
        Because the disease is genetic, there are no cures; treatment revolves
        around minimizing the symptoms and watching for changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Getting the right care for eye problems is essential, including
        prescription glasses, dark glasses to protect the eyes from the sun, and
        regular eye exams. It is also important to watch the skin for changes
        and to use sunblock for protection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Surgery on the optical muscles can sometimes minimize the "shaking" in
        nystagmus. Similarly, operations to minimize strabismus can make it less
        noticeable. The surgery does not improve vision, however, and the level
        of success in reducing symptoms varies from individual to individual.
      </p>
      <p>
        Albinism does not get worse with age, and a child with albinism is able
        to flourish and achieve the same education and employment as a person
        without the condition.
      </p>
      <h2>Complications</h2>
      <p>
        The most common physical problems associated with albinism are the
        increased risk of sunburn and skin cancers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, people with albinism can face significant social issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because they look different, they may be bullied at school or feel like
        an outsider because they do not "fit in" with the rest of their family
        or ethnic group.
      </p>
      <p>
        These social factors can lead to stress, low self-esteem, and isolation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Individuals with albinism in sub-Saharan Africa face the most
        significant difficulties. A study carried out in Nigeria reported that
        they: "Experienced alienation, avoided social interactions and were less
        emotionally stable. Furthermore, affected individuals were less likely
        to complete schooling, find employment, and find partners."
      </p>
      <p>
        Worse still, in some sub-Saharan countries such as Tanzania and Burundi,
        the body parts of individuals with albinism are sought after by witch
        doctors.
      </p>
      <p>
        There have been numerous cases of children with albinism being murdered
        for profit. National Geographic estimated that in 2013, the body parts
        of an albino could make up to $75,000.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some African countries, Tanzania and Zimbabwe particularly, it is
        believed that having sex with a woman with albinism cures AIDS (acquired
        immune deficiency syndrome). This false belief has led to murder, rape,
        and additional AIDS infections.
