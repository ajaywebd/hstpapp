          There is no cure for albinism, but some symptoms can be treated.
        </li>
        <li>Albinism is a genetic disorder.</li>
        <li>Primarily, albinism affects the hair, eyes, skin, and vision.</li>
        <li>
          The most common cause of albinism is an interruption in the
          functioning of the enzyme tyrosinase.
        </li>
        <li>
          An estimated 1 in 70 people carry the genes associated with albinism.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">What is Albinism?</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Albinism is an inherited disease characterized by a substantially lower
        rate of melanin production. Melanin is the pigment responsible for the
        color of the skin, hair, and eyes.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        People with albinism often have lighter-colored skin and hair compared
        to their family or ethnic group, but this is not always the case. Vision
        is always affected to some degree. Due to reduced melanin levels,
        individuals with albinism are more sensitive to UV exposure and have an
        increased risk of skin cancer.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">Symptoms</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The primary symptoms of albinism can be categorized as follows:
      </p>

      <h4 class="acne-sub-title">Skin:</h4>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        People with albinism typically have lighter skin tones, but skin tone
        may darken with age as melanin levels increase. Some individuals may
        develop freckles, pink moles, or large freckle-like spots called
        lentigines after sun exposure.
      </p>

      <h4 class="acne-sub-title">Hair:</h4>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Hair color ranges from white to brown, with variations like yellow or
        reddish hues in people of African or Asian descent. Hair may darken with
        age.
      </p>

      <h4 class="acne-sub-title">Eye Color:</h4>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Eye color varies from light blue to brown and can change with age. Low
        melanin levels can make the eyes appear translucent, and in certain
        lighting, they may look red or pink. This makes individuals sensitive to
        light (photosensitive).
      </p>

      <h4 class="acne-sub-title">Vision:</h4>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Vision is always affected by albinism, with possible changes including:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li><strong>Nystagmus:</strong> Rapid, uncontrollable eye movement.</li>
        <li><strong>Strabismus:</strong> Eyes not functioning in unison.</li>
        <li><strong>Amblyopia:</strong> Also known as "lazy eye."</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Nearsightedness or Farsightedness:</strong> Extreme cases are
          common.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Photophobia:</strong> Sensitivity to light.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Optic Nerve Hypoplasia:</strong> Underdeveloped optic nerve.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Optic Nerve Misrouting:</strong> Unusual nerve routes from
          retina to brain.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Astigmatism:</strong> Blurred vision due to abnormal curvature
          of the eye or lens.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Vision issues are most severe in newborns but generally improve within
        the first six months of life. However, they rarely achieve normal levels
        of eye health.
      </p>
      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Causes</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Albinism is caused by a mutation in one of several genes responsible for
        various aspects of melanin production by melanocytes in the skin and
        eyes. Most commonly, these mutations interfere with the enzyme
        tyrosinase (tyrosine 3-monooxygenase), which synthesizes melanin from
        the amino acid tyrosine.
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Melanin production can be slowed or completely stopped depending on
          the mutation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Associated problems with the visual system are always present because
          melanin plays a vital role in the development of the retina and the
          optic nerve pathways from the eye to the brain.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Types</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Albinism is classified into subgroups based on the specific genes
        affected. These include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>X-linked ocular albinism:</strong> Caused by a mutation in the
          X chromosome, it primarily affects males. Vision problems are present,
          but hair, skin, and eye color are generally normal.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome:</strong> A rare variant most common
          in Puerto Rico. Symptoms resemble oculocutaneous albinism but are
          accompanied by a higher risk of bowel, heart, kidney, lung diseases,
          and bleeding disorders.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chediak-Higashi syndrome:</strong> A rare form caused by
          mutations in the CHS1/LYST genes. Symptoms include silvery hair,
          slightly gray skin, and increased susceptibility to infections due to
          white blood cell defects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA):</strong> This type is caused by
          mutations in one of four genes and has seven subtypes:
          <ul class="acne-list">
            <li>
              <strong>OCA type 1:</strong> Individuals typically have milky
              skin, white hair, and blue eyes. Skin and hair may darken with
              age.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>OCA type 2:</strong> Similar to type 1 but occurs more
              often in sub-Saharan Africans, African-Americans, and Native
              Americans.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>OCA type 3:</strong> Primarily affects black South
              Africans.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>OCA type 4:</strong> Most common in East Asian
              populations.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        As research progresses, more specific mutations are being identified,
        furthering our understanding of albinism.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Inheritance</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Albinism is inherited through two primary patterns: autosomal recessive
        and X-linked inheritance.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">Autosomal Recessive Inheritance</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        In autosomal recessive inheritance, a person must inherit faulty copies
        of a gene from both parents to develop albinism.
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          If both parents carry the gene, there is a 1 in 4 chance their child
          will have albinism and a 1 in 2 chance the child will be a carrier
          without symptoms.
        </li>
        <li>
          Approximately 1 in 70 people carry the gene for albinism but do not
          show symptoms.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">X-Linked Inheritance</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        X-linked recessive conditions primarily affect males, as they have only
        one X chromosome. If this chromosome carries a mutation, the condition
        will develop.
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Females, with two X chromosomes, can carry the mutation without
          developing the condition, as the healthy X chromosome compensates.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the mother has an X-linked mutation, each daughter has a 1 in 2
          chance of being a carrier, and each son has a 1 in 2 chance of having
          albinism.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Diagnosis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The process of diagnosing albinism most often involves:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Physical examination.</li>
        <li>Discussion about skin and hair pigmentation changes.</li>
        <li>Examination of the eyes by an ophthalmologist (eye specialist).</li>
        <li>Comparing the individual's coloration to family members.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Other diseases can also cause changes in pigmentation, but they do not
        cause changes in vision. If both pigment and vision changes are present,
        albinism is the most likely cause.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The most reliable way to diagnose albinism is through genetic testing.
        However, if there is a family history of albinism, genetic testing may
        not be necessary.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Treatment</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Since albinism is a genetic condition, there are no cures. Treatment
        focuses on managing symptoms and monitoring for any changes.
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Proper eye care, including prescription glasses, dark glasses to
          protect against the sun, and regular eye exams.
        </li>
        <li>
          Skin monitoring and protection using sunblock to prevent sunburn and
          skin damage.
        </li>
        <li>
          Surgery on the optical muscles to reduce "shaking" in nystagmus, or on
          strabismus to improve eye alignment. However, these surgeries do not
          improve vision, and the outcomes vary.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Albinism does not worsen with age. Children with albinism can lead
        successful lives, achieving the same educational and employment
        opportunities as others.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title" style="border-bottom: none">
        Complications :
      </h2>
      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">Physical Complications</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The most common physical problems associated with albinism are:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Increased risk of sunburn.</li>
        <li>Higher susceptibility to skin cancers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">Social Complications</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        People with albinism may face significant social challenges:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Bullying at school or feeling isolated due to looking different from
          family or peers.
        </li>
        <li>Stress, low self-esteem, and social isolation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        In sub-Saharan Africa, individuals with albinism face even greater
        difficulties. A study in Nigeria revealed that affected individuals
        experienced alienation, avoided social interactions, and were less
        likely to complete schooling, find employment, or form partnerships.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Worse still, in some African countries, such as Tanzania and Burundi,
        individuals with albinism face violence. Their body parts are sought
        after by witch doctors for profit. For example, in 2013, National
        Geographic estimated that the body parts of an individual with albinism
        could be sold for up to $75,000.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        In Tanzania and Zimbabwe, a false belief persists that having sex with a
        woman with albinism cures AIDS, leading to rape, murder, and further
        spread of the disease.
