          Rhinitis is a reaction that happens in the eyes, nose, and throat. It
          occurs when allergens in the air trigger the release of histamine in
          the body.
        </p>
        <ul class="acne-list">
          <li>
            Allergic rhinitis can happen on a seasonal basis or year-round.
            There is often a family history of allergic rhinitis, eczema,
            asthma, or allergy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your child may be referred to see an allergist for allergy skin
            testing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Common causes include pollen, dust mites, mold, cockroach waste, and
            animal dander.
          </li>
          <li>
            Children with other allergic diseases such as eczema, food allergy,
            and asthma are more likely to also have allergic rhinitis.
          </li>
          <li>
            Treatment may include staying away from allergens and using
            medicines to treat symptoms.
          </li>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Symptoms</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Each child may experience symptoms differently. Common symptoms include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Sneezing</li>
        <li>Stuffy nose</li>
        <li>Runny nose</li>
        <li>Itchy nose, throat, eyes, and ears</li>
        <li>Nosebleeds</li>
        <li>Clear drainage from the nose</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Children with year-round allergic rhinitis may also have these symptoms:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Ear infections that keep coming back</li>
        <li>Snoring</li>
        <li>Breathing through the mouth</li>
        <li>Not doing well in school</li>
        <li>
          A line or crease across the bridge of the nose from often wiping or
          scratching the itchy nose
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The symptoms of allergic rhinitis may look like other conditions or
        health problems. Always talk with your child’s healthcare provider for a
        diagnosis.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">When to see a doctor</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Call your child’s healthcare provider if your child has:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Symptoms that get worse</li>
        <li>New symptoms</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Causes</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The most common causes of allergic rhinitis in children are:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Pollen from trees, grass, or weeds</li>
        <li>Dust mites</li>
        <li>Mold</li>
        <li>Cockroach waste</li>
        <li>Animal dander</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Things such as strong odors and tobacco smoke can cause similar symptoms
        to allergic rhinitis. But these substances are irritants, not allergens.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Risk Factors</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Children with other allergic diseases (such as eczema, food allergy, and
        asthma) are more likely to also have allergic rhinitis. About 8 out of
        10 children with asthma also have allergic rhinitis. For these children,
        allergens are a common cause of asthma attacks. Children whose parents
        have allergies are also at greater risk of developing allergies.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Controlling allergies may help control asthma and eczema in some
        children.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Diagnosis</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        In most cases, your child’s healthcare provider makes the diagnosis
        based on a full health history and physical exam. During the exam, your
        child’s provider may also find:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Dark circles under the eyes</li>
        <li>Creases under the eyes</li>
        <li>Swollen tissue inside the nose</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        If this is the case, then the provider may refer your child to see an
        allergist. An allergist is a healthcare provider who is trained to do
        allergy skin testing. This testing will tell you exactly what things are
        causing your child to have symptoms.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Treatment</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Treatment will depend on your child’s symptoms, age, and general health.
        It will also depend on how severe the condition is.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">Treatment choices may include:</p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Antihistamines</li>
        <li>Nose sprays</li>
        <li>Decongestants</li>
        <li>Medicines for asthma symptoms</li>
        <li>Allergy shots</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Prevention</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Experts don't know how to prevent a person from developing allergic
        rhinitis. But you can help prevent the symptoms by:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Controlling your child's environment, such as using air conditioning
          during pollen season
        </li>
        <li>
          Having your child stay away from areas where there is heavy dust,
          mites, molds
        </li>
        <li>Keeping your child away from pets</li>
      </ul>
