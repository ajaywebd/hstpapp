        A concussion is a type of brain injury caused by a serious hit to the
        head. It can temporarily alter the way the brain works. The skull and
        spinal fluid typically protect the brain, but a hard enough impact can
        cause the brain to shift and hit the inside of the skull, resulting in a
        concussion.

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Signs of a Concussion</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Concussions can be challenging to identify without medical advice. Here
        are some signs that may indicate a concussion:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Loss of consciousness</li>
        <li>Severe or worsening headache</li>
        <li>Blurred vision</li>
        <li>Trouble walking</li>
        <li>Confusion or nonsensical speech</li>
        <li>Slurred speech</li>
        <li>Unresponsiveness</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Parents should call a doctor immediately if the child experiences
        vomiting, dizziness, headache, or trouble concentrating after a head
        injury.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Two Important Steps to Take</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        If a coach or parent suspects a concussion, follow these two steps:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Stop playing or practicing immediately.</li>
        <li>
          Consult a doctor before returning to play or regular activities.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Concussions can happen during sports, bike accidents, or falls. It’s
        crucial to get medical clearance before resuming normal activities.
      </p>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Protect Your Brain</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Kids who rush recovery after a concussion risk further injury because
        they are still wobbly from the first concussion. Incomplete recovery can
        lead to prolonged headaches and difficulty focusing on tasks like
        studying. Your brain is the "boss" of your body — it helps you walk,
        talk, and think, so protecting it is crucial!
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">Want to be a concussion fighter? Here's how:</p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Tell your coach or parent immediately if you hit your head.</li>
        <li>Wear a seatbelt when traveling in a car.</li>
        <li>
          Always wear a helmet during activities like biking, football, hockey,
          or skateboarding.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        While helmets can't prevent a concussion entirely, they can reduce the
        risk of more severe brain injuries. The good news is that most kids
        recover fully after a concussion and can return to normal activities
        like school and sports.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Treatment</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The best treatment for a concussion is complete rest from physical and
        mental activity. Key steps include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Limiting exposure to loud music, computers, and TVs if they worsen
          symptoms.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adjusting schoolwork, postponing tests and projects, and excusing
          students from gym or recess.
        </li>
        <li>
          Monitoring children for worsening symptoms or behavioral changes, such
          as grogginess or agitation, and reporting them to a doctor
          immediately.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Prevention</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Not all concussions can be prevented, but many can be avoided by
        following these precautions:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Wear helmets for activities like biking, skateboarding, or playing
          contact sports (football, hockey, lacrosse).
        </li>
        <li>Ensure helmets fit properly and are in good condition.</li>
        <li>
          Athletes should use safe playing techniques and follow game rules.
        </li>
        <li>
          Encourage athletes to report head injuries to their coach, trainer, or
          parent, even if it means stopping play.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Never ignore a head injury, no matter how minor it seems. Taking these
        precautions helps protect your brain and ensures a full recovery if an
        injury does occur.
