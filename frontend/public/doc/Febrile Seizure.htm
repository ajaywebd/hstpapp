      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Febrile Seizure</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        A febrile seizure is a convulsion in a child caused by a spike in body
        temperature, often due to an infection. It occurs in young children with
        normal development and no history of neurological symptoms. Though
        frightening, febrile seizures are usually harmless and do not indicate
        serious health issues.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">Symptoms</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        A febrile seizure typically involves shaking all over and a loss of
        consciousness. In some cases, stiffness or twitching may occur in one
        area of the body.
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Fever higher than 100.4°F (38.0°C)</li>
        <li>Loss of consciousness</li>
        <li>Shaking or jerking of arms and legs</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">Febrile seizures are classified as:</p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Simple Febrile Seizures:</strong> Lasts a few seconds to 15
          minutes, does not recur within 24 hours, and is not specific to one
          body part.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Complex Febrile Seizures:</strong> Lasts longer than 15
          minutes, occurs more than once within 24 hours, or is confined to one
          side of the body.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        These seizures often occur within 24 hours of fever onset and can be the
        first sign of illness.
      </p>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">When to See a Doctor</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Visit your doctor after your child's first febrile seizure, even if it
          lasts only a few seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
          Call emergency services if the seizure lasts longer than five minutes
          or is accompanied by:
          <ul>
            <li>Vomiting</li>
            <li>A stiff neck</li>
            <li>Breathing problems</li>
            <li>Extreme sleepiness</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">Causes</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Febrile seizures are usually caused by elevated body temperature. Common
        triggers include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Infections:</strong> Viral infections like influenza and
          roseola often cause high fevers, leading to febrile seizures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Post-Immunization Seizures:</strong> Fevers following
          vaccinations such as DTaP or MMR may trigger seizures. The fever—not
          the vaccine—causes the seizure.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">Risk Factors</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Young Age:</strong> Most febrile seizures occur between 6
          months and 5 years, with the highest risk between 12–18 months.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Family History:</strong> A family tendency to have seizures
          with fever can increase susceptibility.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">Diagnosis</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Diagnosis includes reviewing the child's medical history and identifying
        the fever's cause. Tests may include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Simple Febrile Seizures:</strong> Typically diagnosed based on
          history in vaccinated children without other risk factors.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Complex Febrile Seizures:</strong> May require additional
          tests like:
          <ul>
            <li>Blood and urine tests to check for infection</li>
            <li>
              Spinal tap (lumbar puncture) for central nervous system infections
            </li>
            <li>EEG to measure brain activity</li>
            <li>
              MRI for unusual head size, neurological abnormalities, or
              prolonged seizures
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Treatment</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Most febrile seizures stop on their own within a couple of minutes. If
        your child has a febrile seizure, stay calm and follow these steps:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Place your child on his or her side on a surface where they won't
          fall.
        </li>
        <li>Start timing the seizure.</li>
        <li>Stay close to watch and comfort your child.</li>
        <li>Remove hard or sharp objects near your child.</li>
        <li>Loosen tight or restrictive clothing.</li>
        <li>Do not restrain your child or interfere with their movements.</li>
        <li>Do not put anything in your child’s mouth.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        If the seizure lasts more than five minutes or if your child has
        repeated seizures, call emergency medical services immediately.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        For more serious episodes, a doctor may order medication to stop
        prolonged seizures. Your child may need hospitalization for observation
        if:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>The seizure is prolonged.</li>
        <li>The seizure is accompanied by a serious infection.</li>
        <li>The source of the infection cannot be identified.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Hospitalization is usually unnecessary for simple febrile seizures.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Complications</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Most febrile seizures cause no lasting effects. Simple febrile seizures
        do not result in brain damage, intellectual disability, or learning
        disabilities, and they do not indicate a more serious underlying
        disorder.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Febrile seizures are provoked and do not indicate epilepsy, which
        involves unprovoked seizures caused by abnormal brain activity.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">Recurrent Febrile Seizures</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The most common complication is the recurrence of febrile seizures. The
        risk is higher if:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>The first seizure occurred with a low fever.</li>
        <li>The period between the fever's onset and the seizure was short.</li>
        <li>A family member has a history of febrile seizures.</li>
        <li>
          Your child was younger than 18 months at the time of the first
          seizure.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Prevention</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Most febrile seizures occur in the first few hours of a fever during the
        initial rise in body temperature.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">Medications for Comfort</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Giving your child infants' or children's acetaminophen (e.g., Tylenol)
        or ibuprofen (e.g., Motrin) at the beginning of a fever may make them
        more comfortable, but it will not prevent seizures. Avoid giving aspirin
        to children recovering from chickenpox or flu-like symptoms, as it may
        lead to Reye's syndrome, a rare but serious condition.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-sub-title">Prescription Prevention Medications</h3>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Rarely, prescription anticonvulsant medications are used to prevent
        febrile seizures, but their side effects may outweigh their benefits.
        Rectal diazepam (Diastat) or nasal midazolam might be prescribed for
        children prone to long seizures or multiple seizures within 24 hours.
        These medications are used as needed to treat seizures lasting longer
        than five minutes, not to prevent them.
