      <!-- <h2 class="acne-section-title">Overview</h2> -->
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Eczema (eg-zuh-MUH) refers to a group of conditions causing red, itchy,
        and inflamed skin. Common types include atopic dermatitis, contact
        dermatitis, dyshidrotic eczema, and seborrheic dermatitis (or "cradle
        cap" in infants). It often appears in children between 6 months and 5
        years old. Eczema is not contagious and cannot be "caught" from someone
        else.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        While there is no cure, managing eczema involves avoiding triggers,
        daily skin care, and using medications. Treatment options include
        over-the-counter remedies, prescription topical medications,
        phototherapy, and immunosuppressants.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Causes</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Eczema triggers can vary but commonly include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Dry skin</li>
        <li>Irritants</li>
        <li>Heat and sweating</li>
        <li>Infections</li>
        <li>Allergens like pet dander, pollen, or dust</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Winter dryness and drooling can worsen symptoms, particularly on the
        face, chin, and neck in babies. Identifying your child's triggers is
        essential for managing eczema effectively.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Symptoms</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Eczema symptoms and their locations may change with age. In infants, it
        typically appears on the face, elbows, and knees. In older children and
        adults, eczema is more common on the hands, feet, arms, and behind the
        knees.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">Common symptoms include:</p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Dry, scaly skin</li>
        <li>Small bumps that ooze when scratched</li>
        <li>Redness and swelling</li>
        <li>Thickened skin (with chronic eczema)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Excessive scratching can tear the skin and lead to infections. Some
        children may have occasional flare-ups, while others experience symptoms
        into adulthood.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Diagnosis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Eczema is common, affecting at least 10 percent of infants and children,
        according to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and
        Skin Diseases. Diagnosis typically involves a physical exam and medical
        history. Other factors may include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Family history of allergic conditions</li>
        <li>Personal history of allergies or asthma</li>
        <li>Blood tests</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Overview of Treatment</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Specific treatment for eczema will be determined by the child's
        physician based on:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>The child's age, overall health, and medical history</li>
        <li>Extent of the disorder</li>
        <li>
          The child's tolerance for specific medications, procedures, or
          therapies
        </li>
        <li>Expectations for the course of the reaction</li>
        <li>Child or parent's opinion or preference</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        <strong>Note:</strong> There is no cure for eczema. The primary goals of
        treatment are to reduce itching and inflammation, moisturize the skin,
        and prevent infection.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Developing Treatments</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        A new class of medications, called topical immunomodulators (TIMs),
        offers a steroid-free option for treating atopic dermatitis. These
        medications relieve itching, redness, and pain caused by eczema and can
        be used anywhere on the body.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        <strong>Tacrolimus</strong> is the first TIM approved by the US Food and
        Drug Administration (FDA). Another promising TIM is
        <strong>pimecrolimus</strong>. However, the FDA advises against using
        TIMs on children under two years old. Always consult with the child's
        physician for detailed information.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">How to Manage Eczema</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        The following are suggestions for managing eczema effectively:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Avoid contact with irritants as determined by the child's physician
        </li>
        <li>
          Bathe the child regularly, use moisturizers, and practice good skin
          care techniques
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep the child's room cool at night to prevent sweating, which can
          irritate the skin
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid harsh soaps; ask the child's physician to recommend a brand
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep the child's fingernails short to minimize scratching that may
          lead to infection
        </li>
        <li>
          Apply lubricating lotions at least once daily; consult the child's
          physician for recommended brands
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-section-title">Treatment for Severe Eczema</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        In severe cases, the child's physician may prescribe medications. Common
        treatments include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Antihistamines:</strong> These medications reduce itching.
          Examples include diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) and hydroxyzine
          (Atarax®). They may cause drowsiness, but newer non-drowsy options are
          available. Consult the physician for recommendations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Steroid creams:</strong> These topical medications help reduce
          skin inflammation, itching, and swelling. They come in various
          strengths and should be used according to the physician's advice, as
          overuse may damage the skin.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Oral antibiotics:</strong> These may be prescribed if an
          infection occurs due to excessive scratching or broken skin.
        </li>
      </ul>
