      <h1 class="acne-page-title">Atrial Septal Defect (ASD)</h1>
      <p class="acne-main-text acne-left-img">
        An atrial septal defect (ASD) is an opening in the atrial septum, the
        wall between the heart's upper chambers, the right and left atria. ASD
        can be congenital (present at birth) or result from the failure of
        normal postnatal closure of a fetal hole. This defect allows oxygen-rich
        blood to pass from the left atrium to the right atrium, mixing with
        oxygen-poor blood.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Atrial septal defects occur in a small percentage of children born with
        congenital heart disease. Girls are twice as likely as boys to have
        ASDs.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Causes</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        ASDs usually occur during fetal development when the heart partitions
        don’t fully form, leaving an opening in the atrial septum. Some
        congenital heart defects may have genetic links or result from
        environmental exposure, although most ASDs occur sporadically without a
        clear cause.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Types of Atrial Septal Defects</h2>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Ostium secundum ASD:</strong> The most common type, resulting
          from an incomplete closure in the central part of the septum.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ostium primum ASD:</strong> Associated with atrioventricular
          canal defects and often involves a cleft in the mitral valve.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sinus venosus ASD:</strong> Occurs near the superior vena cava
          and the junction with the right atrium, causing abnormal drainage of
          the pulmonary veins.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Coronary sinus ASD:</strong> Located in the coronary sinus
          wall, this rare defect involves the area where the coronary veins
          drain into the right atrium.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Why is an ASD a Concern?</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        An ASD can lead to lung problems if left untreated, as the right side of
        the heart must handle an increased blood volume, which then flows into
        the lungs. Over time, this can lead to high blood pressure in the lungs
        and irreversible lung damage.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Symptoms</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        While many children show no symptoms, larger ASDs may cause:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Easy fatigue during play</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Sweating</li>
        <li>Rapid breathing</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath</li>
        <li>Poor growth</li>
        <li>Frequent respiratory infections</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        ASD symptoms can resemble other heart conditions, so a physician should
        be consulted for a proper diagnosis.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Diagnosis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Diagnosis may involve a medical history review and physical examination,
        along with various procedures:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG):</strong> Measures heart
          electrical activity and detects arrhythmias. Variations include:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Resting ECG:</strong> Performed while lying down, with
              electrodes placed on the chest, arms, and legs to record heart
              activity.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Exercise ECG (stress test):</strong> Performed while the
              child exercises to assess heart function under stress.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Holter monitor:</strong> A portable ECG worn for 24+ hours
              to record heart activity continuously. Two types:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Continuous recording:</strong> Records throughout the
                  testing period.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Event monitor:</strong> Records only during symptoms
                  or abnormal rhythms.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Electrophysiologic study (EPS):</strong> An invasive test
          using a catheter to find the arrhythmia's origin. An esophageal
          electrophysiologic study may also be used, with a thin tube inserted
          into the esophagus for precise ECG recording.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tilt table test:</strong> Recommended for children with
          frequent fainting episodes to observe heart rate and blood pressure
          response to positional changes. Medication may be given intravenously
          during the test to prevent fainting.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Treatment</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Treatment for an atrial septal defect (ASD) depends on your child's
        symptoms, age, and general health, as well as the severity of the
        condition. The most common type of ASD may close on its own as the child
        grows.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Once ASD is diagnosed, the cardiologist will monitor the child to see if
        the defect closes on its own. An ASD will usually be repaired if it
        hasn’t closed by the time a child reaches school age, especially if the
        defect is large.
      </p>
      <h3 class="acne-section-title">Treatment may include:</h3>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Medicine:</strong> Many children show no symptoms and don’t
          need medication, but some benefit from medicines that support heart
          function, such as diuretics to help the kidneys eliminate extra fluid.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Surgery:</strong> In some cases, the ASD is repaired
          surgically under general anesthesia, using stitches or a special patch
          to close the defect.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Device closure:</strong> Some children benefit from this
          procedure, where a septal occluder device is placed in the ASD through
          cardiac catheterization, stopping the abnormal blood flow.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Living with Atrial Septal Defect</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        All children with an ASD require care from a pediatric cardiologist.
        Most children who undergo ASD repair live healthy lives. Post-repair,
        the doctor may prescribe antibiotics to prevent bacterial endocarditis,
        an infection of the heart lining.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Early diagnosis and repair generally lead to excellent outcomes, with
        minimal follow-up care required. Children diagnosed with ASD later in
        life or who experience complications post-repair may face greater risks.
        Some children may develop pulmonary hypertension and should receive
        follow-up care at a congenital heart disease center.
      </p>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Consult your child’s healthcare provider for personalized information
        about your child's prognosis.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Key Points</h2>
