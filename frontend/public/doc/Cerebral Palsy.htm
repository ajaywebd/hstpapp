      <h1 class="acne-page-title">Cerebral Palsy</h1>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Cerebral palsy (CP) is a brain (neurological) disorder that causes
        problems with normal motor function. It is a lifelong condition that
        affects how the brain and muscles communicate. CP affects body movement,
        muscle control, coordination, reflexes, posture, and balance. These
        problems are caused by damage to or abnormal development of certain
        brain areas. Many children with CP have normal intelligence. While CP
        doesnâ€™t get worse over time, it also does not improve. Diagnosis and
        treatment can help children learn to manage their condition.
      </p>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Types of Cerebral Palsy</h2>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          Spastic cerebral palsy - causes stiffness and movement difficulties
        </li>
        <li>
          Dyskinetic (athetoid) cerebral palsy - leads to involuntary and
          uncontrolled movements
        </li>
        <li>
          Ataxic cerebral palsy - causes problems with balance and depth
          perception
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Causes</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        CP occurs when there is abnormal development or damage to brain areas
        controlling motor function. This can happen before or during birth
        (congenital CP) or, less commonly, after birth (acquired CP). The exact
        cause is often unknown but may include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Lack of oxygen to the brain</li>
        <li>Genetic conditions</li>
        <li>Infections</li>
        <li>Bleeding in the brain</li>
        <li>Severe jaundice</li>
        <li>Head injury</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Children at Risk</h2>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Preterm birth</li>
        <li>
          Inflammation of the placenta or amniotic fluid (chorioamnionitis)
        </li>
        <li>Blood clotting disorders</li>
        <li>Very low birth weight</li>
        <li>Exposure to infections or harmful substances during pregnancy</li>
        <li>Complications during labor and delivery</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Symptoms</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Symptoms of CP vary widely and may include muscle weakness, poor motor
        control, or involuntary movements. Children with CP may also have
        additional problems such as seizures, vision or hearing issues, learning
        disabilities, and bowel or bladder problems.
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Spastic diplegia: Spastic movements in the arms or legs</li>
        <li>Spastic quadriplegia: Spastic movements in all four limbs</li>
        <li>Spastic hemiplegia: Spasticity affecting one side of the body</li>
        <li>Athetoid: Involuntary and purposeless movements</li>
        <li>Ataxic: Issues with balance and coordination</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Diagnosis</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Diagnosis typically occurs between 6 and 12 months of age when
        developmental milestones like walking and head control are expected.
        Diagnostic methods include:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Neurological examinations</li>
        <li>X-rays</li>
        <li>Feeding studies</li>
        <li>Electroencephalogram (EEG)</li>
        <li>Blood tests</li>
        <li>Gait lab analysis</li>
        <li>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</li>
        <li>Computed tomography (CT) scans</li>
        <li>Genetic studies</li>
        <li>Metabolic tests</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Treatment</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Specific treatment for cerebral palsy will be determined by your child's
        doctor based on:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Your child's age, overall health, and medical history</li>
        <li>The extent of the disease</li>
        <li>The type of CP</li>
        <li>
          Your child's tolerance for specific medications, procedures, or
          therapies
        </li>
        <li>Expectations for the course of the disease</li>
        <li>Your opinion or preference</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Since CP is a lifelong condition that is not correctable, management
        focuses on preventing or minimizing deformities and maximizing the
        child's capability at home and in the community. An interdisciplinary
        team often treats children with CP, including the following specialists:
      </p>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>Pediatrician/family practitioner</li>
        <li>Orthopedic surgeon</li>
        <li>Neurologist</li>
        <li>Neurosurgeon</li>
        <li>Ophthalmologist</li>
        <li>Dentist</li>
        <li>Nurse</li>
        <li>Orthotist</li>
        <li>
          Rehabilitation team (physical, occupational, speech therapy,
          audiology)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Management Options</h2>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Nonsurgical Interventions:</strong> Rehabilitation,
          positioning aids, braces, medications for seizures or muscle
          spasticity
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Surgical Interventions:</strong> Address orthopedic problems,
          spasticity, and severe deformities like scoliosis
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Long-Term Outlook</h2>
      <p class="acne-main-text">
        Since CP is a lifelong condition, management focuses on preventing
        deformities and promoting independence. Positive reinforcement
        strengthens self-esteem and helps children maximize their capabilities.
        The full extent of the condition may not be understood until the child
        grows.
      </p>
      <h2 class="acne-sub-title">Associated Problems</h2>
      <ul class="acne-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Intellectual Disability:</strong> Some children may have
          intellectual disabilities or learning disorders, while others may have
          normal intelligence.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Seizures:</strong> Affect one in three children with CP, often
          controllable with medication.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Vision Difficulties:</strong> Strabismus and other issues may
          require early correction to prevent permanent damage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Limb Shortening and Scoliosis:</strong> Differences in limb
          length and curvature of the spine may need surgical intervention or
          orthotic support.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dental Problems:</strong> Poor oral hygiene and enamel defects
          increase the risk of cavities and gum disease.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hearing Loss:</strong> Some children with CP have partial or
          complete hearing loss, especially if caused by severe jaundice or
          oxygen deficiency at birth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Joint Problems:</strong> Spasticity may cause joint
          contractures, requiring therapy or braces for improved mobility.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Problems with Spatial Awareness:</strong> Many children with
          one-sided CP struggle to sense the position of their affected limbs,
          requiring therapy to improve functionality.
        </li>
