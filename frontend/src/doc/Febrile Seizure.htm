      <h1>Febrile Seizure</h1>
      <p>
        A febrile seizure is a convulsion in a child caused by a spike in body
        temperature, often from an infection. They occur in young children with
        normal development without a history of neurologic symptoms. It can be
        frightening when your child has a febrile seizure, and the few minutes
        it lasts can seem like an eternity. Fortunately, they're usually
        harmless and typically don't indicate a serious health problem.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can help by keeping your child safe during a febrile seizure and by
        offering comfort afterward. Call your doctor to have your child
        evaluated as soon as possible after a febrile seizure.
      </p>

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>
      <p>
        Usually, a child having a febrile seizure shakes all over and loses
        consciousness. Sometimes, the child may get very stiff or twitch in just
        one area of the body.
      </p>
      <p>A child having a febrile seizure may:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Have a fever higher than 100.4 F (38.0 C)</li>
        <li>Lose consciousness</li>
        <li>Shake or jerk arms and legs</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Febrile seizures are classified as simple or complex:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Simple febrile seizures</b>: This most common type lasts from a few
          seconds to 15 minutes. Simple febrile seizures do not recur within a
          24-hour period and are not specific to one part of the body.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Complex febrile seizures</b>: This type lasts longer than 15
          minutes, occurs more than once within 24 hours or is confined to one
          side of your child's body.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Febrile seizures most often occur within 24 hours of the onset of a
        fever and can be the first sign that a child is ill.
      </p>

      <h2>When to See a Doctor</h2>
      <p>
        See your child's doctor as soon as possible after your child's first
        febrile seizure, even if it lasts only a few seconds. Call an ambulance
        to take your child to the emergency room if the seizure lasts longer
        than five minutes or is accompanied by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Vomiting</li>
        <li>A stiff neck</li>
        <li>Breathing problems</li>
        <li>Extreme sleepiness</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Causes</h2>
      <p>
        Usually, a higher-than-normal body temperature causes febrile seizures.
        Even a low-grade fever can trigger a febrile seizure.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Infection</b>: The fevers that trigger febrile seizures are usually
        caused by a viral infection, and less commonly by a bacterial infection.
        Influenza and the virus that causes roseola, which often are accompanied
        by high fevers, appear to be most frequently associated with febrile
        seizures.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Post-immunization seizures</b>: The risk of febrile seizures may
        increase after some childhood immunizations. These include the
        diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis or measles-mumps-rubella
        vaccinations. A child can develop a low-grade fever after a vaccination.
        The fever, not the vaccination, causes the seizure.
      </p>

      <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
      <p>Factors that increase the risk of having a febrile seizure include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Young age</b>: Most febrile seizures occur in children between 6
          months and 5 years of age, with the greatest risk between 12 and 18
          months of age.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Family history</b>: Some children inherit a family tendency to have
          seizures with a fever. Additionally, researchers have linked several
          genes to a susceptibility to febrile seizures.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
      <p>
        Febrile seizures occur in children with normal development. Your doctor
        will carefully review your child's medical history and developmental
        history to exclude other risk factors for epilepsy. In normally
        developing children, identifying the cause of your child's fever is the
        first step after a febrile seizure.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Simple febrile seizures</b>: Children who are current with their
        vaccinations who have a first simple febrile seizure don't need testing.
        Your doctor can diagnose the febrile seizure based on history.
      </p>
      <p>
        In children with delayed immunization or a compromised immune system,
        your doctor may recommend tests to look for severe infections, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A blood test</li>
        <li>A urine test</li>
        <li>
          A spinal tap (lumbar puncture), to find out if your child has a
          central nervous system infection, such as meningitis
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <b>Complex febrile seizures</b>: To diagnose the cause of a complex
        febrile seizure, your doctor may also recommend an electroencephalogram
        (EEG), a test that measures brain activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your doctor may also recommend an MRI to check your child's brain if
        your child has:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>An unusually large head</li>
        <li>An abnormal neurological evaluation</li>
        <li>Signs and symptoms of increased pressure in the skull</li>
        <li>A febrile seizure that lasted an unusually long time</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
      <p>
        Most febrile seizures stop on their own within a couple of minutes. If
        your child has a febrile seizure, stay calm and follow these steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Place your child on their side on a surface where they won't fall.
        </li>
        <li>Start timing the seizure.</li>
        <li>Stay close to watch and comfort your child.</li>
        <li>Remove hard or sharp objects near your child.</li>
        <li>Loosen tight or restrictive clothing.</li>
        <li>
          Don't restrain your child or interfere with your child's movements.
        </li>
        <li>Don't put anything in your child's mouth.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If your child has a febrile seizure that lasts more than five minutes or
        if your child has repeated seizures, call for emergency medical
        attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>More-serious episodes</b>: A doctor may order medication to stop a
        seizure that lasts longer than five minutes.
      </p>
      <p>Your child's doctor may hospitalize the child for observation if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The seizure is prolonged</li>
        <li>The seizure is accompanied by a serious infection</li>
        <li>The source of the infection can't be found</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But a hospital stay isn't usually necessary for simple febrile seizures.
      </p>

      <h2>Complications</h2>
      <p>
        Most febrile seizures produce no lasting effects. Simple febrile
        seizures don't cause brain damage, intellectual disability, or learning
        disabilities, and they don't mean your child has a more serious
        underlying disorder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Febrile seizures are provoked seizures and don't indicate epilepsy.
        Epilepsy is a condition characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures
        caused by abnormal electrical signals in the brain.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Recurrent febrile seizures</b>: The most common complication is the
        possibility of more febrile seizures. The risk of recurrence is higher
        if:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your child's first seizure resulted from a low fever.</li>
        <li>
          The period between the start of the fever and the seizure was short.
        </li>
        <li>An immediate family member has a history of febrile seizures.</li>
        <li>
          Your child was younger than 18 months at the time of the first febrile
          seizure.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Prevention</h2>
      <p>
        Most febrile seizures occur in the first few hours of a fever, during
        the initial rise in body temperature.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Giving your child medications</b>: Giving your child infants' or
        children's acetaminophen (Children's Non-Aspirin Tylenol, others) or
        ibuprofen (Infants' Motrin, Children's Motrin, others) at the beginning
        of a fever may make your child more comfortable, but it won't prevent a
        seizure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use caution when giving aspirin to children or teenagers. Though aspirin
        is approved for use in children older than age 3, children and teenagers
        recovering from chickenpox or flu-like symptoms should never take
        aspirin. This is because aspirin has been linked to Reye's syndrome, a
        rare but potentially life-threatening condition, in such children.
      </p>

      <h3>Prescription Prevention Medications</h3>
      <p>
        Rarely, prescription anticonvulsant medications are used to try to
        prevent febrile seizures. However, these medications can have serious
        side effects that may outweigh any possible benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rectal diazepam (Diastat) or nasal midazolam might be prescribed to be
        used as needed for children who are prone to long febrile seizures.
        These medications are typically used to treat seizures that last longer
        than five minutes or if the child has more than one seizure within 24
        hours. They are not typically used to prevent febrile seizures.
