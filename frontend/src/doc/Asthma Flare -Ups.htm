      <h1>Asthma Flare-Ups</h1>

      <p>Keeping asthma under control helps kids avoid breathing problems.</p>

      <p>
        But sometimes, asthma symptoms get worse, making kids wheeze, cough, or
        be short of breath. This is known as an asthma flare-up (also called an
        asthma attack, episode, or exacerbation).
      </p>

      <p>If the flare-up is severe, a kid might:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          struggle to breathe or have rapid breathing even when sitting still
        </li>
        <li>
          be unable to speak more than a few words at a time without pausing
        </li>
        <li>
          have retractions (sucking in of muscles in the neck and chest) while
          breathing in
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What Happens in an Asthma Flare-Up?</h2>

      <p>
        In the lungs, airways let air in and out. When someone has asthma, these
        airways (also called bronchial tubes and bronchioles) might be slightly
        inflamed or swollen, even when the person seems to be breathing fine.
      </p>

      <p>During a flare-up:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The inflammation gets worse. Sticky mucus clogs the airways and their
          walls get more swollen.
        </li>
        <li>
          The muscles around the airways get tight, further narrowing them (this
          is called bronchoconstriction).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These problems leave very little room in the airways for air to flow
        through—think of a straw that's being pinched.
      </p>

      <h2>Causes</h2>

      <p>
        People with asthma have airways that are overly sensitive to some things
        (called triggers). Being around triggers can bring on asthma symptoms.
      </p>

      <p>Common triggers include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>tobacco smoke</li>
        <li>cold air</li>
        <li>exercise</li>
        <li>infections, such as colds</li>
        <li>animal dander</li>
        <li>dust mites</li>
        <li>mold</li>
        <li>cockroaches</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Many people with asthma also have allergies. For them, allergens—the
        things that cause the allergic symptoms—also can cause asthma flare-ups.
      </p>

      <p>
        If not treated, a flare-up can last for several hours or even days.
        Quick-relief medicines (also called rescue medicines or fast-acting
        medicines) often stop the symptoms pretty quickly. A person should feel
        better once the flare-up ends, although this can take several days.
      </p>

      <h2>Signs</h2>

      <p>
        Asthma flare-ups can vary in strength and length. They can happen
        without warning, causing sudden coughing, shortness of breath, and
        wheezing.
      </p>

      <p>
        But because people with asthma have inflamed airways that get worse with
        gradual exposure to triggers, flare-ups also can build over time,
        especially when asthma isn't well controlled.
      </p>

      <p>
        Flare-ups should be treated right away. It's important to know their
        early warning signs, including:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>coughing</li>
        <li>throat clearing</li>
        <li>rapid or irregular breathing</li>
        <li>being very tired</li>
        <li>trouble doing everyday activities</li>
        <li>restless sleep or coughing that prevents sleep</li>
        <li>mild chest tightness or wheezing</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        A peak flow meter can help predict a flare-up, but not all flare-ups can
        be prevented.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because they can be life-threatening, flare-ups demand attention. Your
        child might need to take quick-relief medicine (which acts quickly to
        relieve symptoms), visit the doctor, or even go to the hospital.
      </p>

      <p>
        Following the instructions in your child's asthma action plan can help
        you know what to do when a flare-up happens.
      </p>

      <h2>Prevention</h2>

      <p>To help prevent flare-ups:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Make sure your child always has quick-relief medicine available.
        </li>
        <li>Teach your child how to avoid asthma triggers.</li>
        <li>
          Make sure your child takes the long-term control medicine (also called
          controller medicine or maintenance medicine) as the doctor directed.
          Even when your child feels well, it's important not to skip it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure your child gets a yearly flu vaccine, and washes his or her
          hands well and often to avoid germs that lead to colds and other
          illnesses.
        </li>
        <li>Work with the doctor on an effective asthma action plan.</li>
      </ul>
