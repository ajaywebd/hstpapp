      <h1>Dyslexia</h1>

      <p>
        Dyslexia is a learning disorder that involves difficulty reading due to
        problems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to
        letters and words (decoding). Also called reading disability, dyslexia
        affects areas of the brain that process language.
      </p>

      <p>
        People with dyslexia have normal intelligence and usually have normal
        vision. Most children with dyslexia can succeed in school with tutoring
        or a specialized education program. Emotional support also plays an
        important role.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though there is no cure for dyslexia, early assessment and intervention
        result in the best outcome. Sometimes dyslexia goes undiagnosed for
        years and isn’t recognized until adulthood, but it’s never too late to
        seek help.
      </p>

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>

      <p>
        Signs of dyslexia can be difficult to recognize before your child enters
        school, but some early clues may indicate a problem. Once your child
        reaches school age, your child’s teacher may be the first to notice a
        problem. Severity varies, but the condition often becomes apparent as a
        child starts learning to read.
      </p>

      <h3>Before School</h3>

      <p>Signs that a young child may be at risk of dyslexia include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Late talking</li>
        <li>Learning new words slowly</li>
        <li>
          Problems forming words correctly, such as reversing sounds in words or
          confusing words that sound alike
        </li>
        <li>Problems remembering or naming letters, numbers, and colors</li>
        <li>Difficulty learning nursery rhymes or playing rhyming games</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>School Age</h3>

      <p>
        Once your child is in school, dyslexia signs and symptoms may become
        more apparent, including:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Reading well below the expected level for age</li>
        <li>Problems processing and understanding what he or she hears</li>
        <li>
          Difficulty finding the right word or forming answers to questions
        </li>
        <li>Problems remembering the sequence of things</li>
        <li>
          Difficulty seeing (and occasionally hearing) similarities and
          differences in letters and words
        </li>
        <li>Inability to sound out the pronunciation of an unfamiliar word</li>
        <li>Difficulty spelling</li>
        <li>
          Spending an unusually long time completing tasks that involve reading
          or writing
        </li>
        <li>Avoiding activities that involve reading</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Teens and Adults</h3>

      <p>
        Dyslexia signs in teens and adults are similar to those in children.
        Some common signs include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Difficulty reading, including reading aloud</li>
        <li>Slow and labor-intensive reading and writing</li>
        <li>Problems spelling</li>
        <li>Avoiding activities that involve reading</li>
        <li>Mispronouncing names or words, or problems retrieving words</li>
        <li>Trouble understanding jokes or idioms</li>
        <li>
          Spending an unusually long time completing tasks that involve reading
          or writing
        </li>
        <li>Difficulty summarizing a story</li>
        <li>Trouble learning a foreign language</li>
        <li>Difficulty memorizing</li>
        <li>Difficulty doing math problems</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Causes</h2>

      <p>
        Researchers haven’t yet pinpointed exactly what causes dyslexia.
        However, genes and brain differences play a role. Some possible causes
        include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Genes and Heredity</b>: Dyslexia often runs in families. About 40%
          of siblings of kids with dyslexia have the same reading issues, and as
          many as 49% of parents of kids with dyslexia have it, too. Certain
          genes are linked to reading and language processing problems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Brain Anatomy and Activity</b>: Brain imaging studies show
          differences in the brain of people with dyslexia, especially in areas
          related to recognizing sounds and reading. However, brain activity
          changes with proper tutoring due to neuroplasticity.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Risk Factors</h2>

      <p>Dyslexia risk factors include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A family history of dyslexia or other learning disabilities</li>
        <li>Premature birth or low birth weight</li>
        <li>
          Exposure during pregnancy to nicotine, drugs, alcohol, or infection
          that may affect brain development
        </li>
        <li>
          Individual differences in the parts of the brain that enable reading
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>

      <p>
        No single test can diagnose dyslexia. Several factors are considered,
        including:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Development, educational issues, and medical history</b>: The
          doctor may ask about conditions that run in the family or learning
          disabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Home life</b>: The doctor may ask about your family environment and
          possible issues at home.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Questionnaires</b>: Tests may be given to assess reading and
          language abilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Vision, hearing, and neurological tests</b>: These tests help rule
          out other possible causes of reading difficulties.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Psychological testing</b>: Questions to assess whether social
          problems, anxiety, or depression are limiting your child’s abilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Reading and academic skills tests</b>: Your child may take
          educational tests, and their reading skills will be assessed by a
          reading expert.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>

      <p>
        Dyslexia is a lifelong problem. However, early intervention and
        appropriate treatment can improve success. Treatments include:
      </p>

      <h3>Educational Techniques</h3>

      <p>
        Dyslexia is treated using specific educational techniques. Teachers may
        use methods that involve hearing, vision, and touch to improve reading
        skills, such as tracing letters while listening to sounds.
      </p>

      <h3>Treatment Focus</h3>

      <p>Treatment focuses on helping your child:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Recognize and use the smallest sounds that make up words (phonemes)
        </li>
        <li>
          Understand how letters and letter combinations represent these sounds
          (phonics)
        </li>
        <li>Comprehend what they are reading</li>
        <li>Read aloud to build fluency</li>
        <li>Build a vocabulary of recognized and understood words</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Individual Education Plan (IEP)</h3>

      <p>
        Schools in the U.S. are legally required to provide support through an
        Individualized Education Plan (IEP) for children diagnosed with
        dyslexia.
      </p>

      <h3>Early Treatment</h3>

      <p>
        Children who receive help early (in kindergarten or first grade) can
        improve enough to succeed in school. Those who don’t get help until
        later may continue to struggle academically.
      </p>

      <h2>What Parents Can Do</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Address the problem early</b>: If you suspect dyslexia, talk to
          your child's doctor and pursue early intervention.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Read aloud to your child</b>: Start reading to your child at a
          young age, and encourage listening to recorded books.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Work with your child’s school</b>: Collaborate with teachers to
          create a plan that helps your child succeed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Encourage reading time</b>: Set aside time for regular reading
          practice.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Set an example for reading</b>: Show your child that reading can be
          enjoyable by reading alongside them.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Complications</h2>

      <p>
        Dyslexia can lead to various complications, including trouble learning,
        social problems, and difficulties as an adult.
      </p>

      <p>
        Children with dyslexia may also have attention-deficit/hyperactivity
        disorder (ADHD), which can complicate treatment.
