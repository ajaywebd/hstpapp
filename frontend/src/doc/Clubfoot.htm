      <h1><b>Clubfoot</b></h1>

      <p>
        Clubfoot is a deformity of the foot. It’s when one or both feet are
        turned inward. The condition affects the bones, muscles, tendons, and
        blood vessels. Clubfoot is present at birth. It tends to affect more
        boys than girls.
      </p>

      <p><b>Causes</b></p>

      <p>
        The cause of clubfoot is unknown (idiopathic), but it may be a
        combination of genetics and environment.
      </p>

      <p><b>Risk factors</b></p>

      <p>Risk factors include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Family history:</b> If either of the parents or their other
          children have had clubfoot, the baby is more likely to have it as
          well.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Congenital conditions:</b> In some cases, clubfoot can be
          associated with other abnormalities of the skeleton that are present
          at birth (congenital), such as spina bifida, a serious birth defect
          that occurs when the tissue surrounding the developing spinal cord of
          a fetus doesn't close properly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Environment:</b> If a woman with a family history of clubfoot
          smokes during pregnancy, her baby's risk of the condition may be
          double that of nonsmokers. Also, getting an infection or using
          recreational drugs during pregnancy can increase the risk of clubfoot.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Not enough amniotic fluid during pregnancy:</b> Too little of the
          fluid that surrounds the baby in the womb may increase the risk of
          clubfoot.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Symptoms of clubfoot in a child</b></p>

      <p>If your child has clubfoot, here's what it might look like:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The top of the foot is usually twisted downward and inward, increasing
          the arch and turning the heel inward.
        </li>
        <li>
          The foot may be turned so severely that it actually looks as if it's
          upside down.
        </li>
        <li>
          The calf muscles in the affected leg are usually underdeveloped.
        </li>
        <li>
          The affected foot may be up to 1/2 inch (about 1 centimeter) shorter
          than the other foot.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Despite its look, however, clubfoot itself doesn't cause any discomfort
        or pain.
      </p>

      <p><b>Diagnosis</b></p>

      <p>
        Most commonly, a doctor recognizes clubfoot soon after birth just from
        looking at the shape and positioning of the newborn's foot.
        Occasionally, the doctor may request X-rays to fully understand how
        severe the clubfoot is, but usually, X-rays are not necessary.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's possible to clearly see some cases of clubfoot before birth during
        an ultrasound exam. While nothing can be done before birth to solve the
        problem, knowing about the condition may give you time to learn more
        about clubfoot and get in touch with appropriate health experts, such as
        a genetic counselor or an orthopedic surgeon.
      </p>

      <p><b>Treatment</b></p>

      <p>
        Treatment will depend on your child's symptoms, age, and general health.
        It will also depend on how severe the condition is.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal of treatment is to straighten the foot so that it can grow and
        develop normally. Without treatment, your child would have trouble
        walking. Treatment choices include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Nonsurgery treatments:</b> These are usually tried first no matter
          how severe the deformity is. The most common treatment in the U.S. is
          the Ponseti method. It uses gentle stretching and a cast to gradually
          fix clubfoot. It often takes about 2 to 3 months. Other methods
          include taping, physical therapy, and splinting.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Braces:</b> Because clubfoot may happen again, your child will have
          to wear braces for several years to prevent relapse. At first, the
          braces are worn for 23 hours a day for up to 3 months. Then they are
          worn at night for 2 to 4 years.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Surgery:</b> Your child may need surgery if other treatments don't
          fix clubfoot. The specific surgery depends on the type and extent of
          the deformity. Your child may need surgical wires, pins, or a cast to
          keep the foot in place until it has healed.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Most infants with clubfoot don't need surgery. Those who do may need
        more than one surgery because the deformity may come back as the child
        grows and develops.
      </p>

      <p><b>Complications</b></p>

      <p>
        Clubfoot typically doesn't cause any problems until your child starts to
        stand and walk. If the clubfoot is treated, your child will most likely
        walk fairly normally. He or she may have some difficulty with:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Movement:</b> Mobility may be slightly limited.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Shoe size:</b> The affected foot may be up to 1 1/2 shoe sizes
          smaller than the unaffected foot.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Calf size:</b> The muscles of the calf on the affected side may
          always be smaller than the other side.
        </li>
        <li><b>Arthritis:</b> Your child is likely to develop arthritis.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Poor self-image:</b> The unusual appearance of the foot may make
          your child's body image a concern during the teen years.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Inability to walk normally:</b> The twist of the ankle may not
          allow your child to walk on the sole of the foot. To compensate, he or
          she may walk on the ball of the foot, the outside of the foot, or even
          the top of the foot in severe cases.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Problems stemming from walking adjustments:</b> Walking adjustments
          may prevent natural growth of the calf muscles, cause large sores or
          calluses on the foot, and result in an awkward gait.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Prevention</b></p>

      <p>
        Because doctors don't know what causes clubfoot, you can't completely
        prevent it. However, if you're pregnant, you can do things to limit your
        baby's risk of birth defects, such as:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Not smoking or spending time in smoky environments</li>
        <li>Not drinking alcohol</li>
        <li>Avoiding drugs not approved by your doctor</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Key points</b></p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Clubfoot is a deformity of the foot:</b> It's when one or both feet
          are turned inward.

          <b
            >Children with a family history of the condition are more likely to
            be born with it.</b
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <b
            >Clubfoot causes the heel to point downward while the front half of
            the foot (forefoot) turns inward.</b
          >
          The foot is usually short and broad in appearance.
        </li>
        <li><b>Most cases of clubfoot are diagnosed at birth.</b></li>
        <li>
          <b
            >Treatment includes stretching and casting. Your child may need
            surgery if other methods don’t work.</b
