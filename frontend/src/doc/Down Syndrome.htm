      <h1>Down Syndrome</h1>

      <p>
        Down syndrome is a genetic disorder. It is also called trisomy 21. It
        includes certain birth defects, learning problems, and facial features.
        A child with Down syndrome may also have heart defects and problems with
        vision and hearing. The severity or mildness of these problems varies
        from child to child.
      </p>

      <p>
        Down syndrome is one of the most common genetic birth defects, affecting
        about 1 in 800 babies. Adults with Down syndrome may live about 60
        years, although this can vary.
      </p>

      <h2>Causes</h2>

      <p>
        When a baby is conceived, a normal egg and sperm cell each have 46
        chromosomes. These cells then divide in half, leaving 23 chromosomes
        each. When a sperm with 23 chromosomes fertilizes an egg with 23
        chromosomes, the baby will have a full set of 46 chromosomes, half from
        the father and half from the mother.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes an error occurs during cell division, where an egg or sperm
        may keep both copies of chromosome number 21. If fertilized, the baby
        will have three copies of chromosome 21, known as trisomy 21.
      </p>

      <p>
        In some cases, part of the extra chromosome 21 is attached to another
        chromosome, leading to translocation Down syndrome, which may be
        inherited from a parent. A rare form, mosaic trisomy 21, occurs when the
        error happens after fertilization, resulting in some cells with an extra
        chromosome 21.
      </p>

      <h2>Risk Factors</h2>

      <p>
        The mother’s age at childbirth is the only known factor linked to an
        increased risk of having a baby with Down syndrome, with the risk
        increasing after age 35. However, most babies with Down syndrome are
        born to women younger than 35 because younger women tend to have more
        children.
      </p>

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>

      <p>The symptoms of Down syndrome vary but can include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Upward-slanting eyes</li>
        <li>Small ears, possibly folded at the top</li>
        <li>Small mouth, making the tongue appear large</li>
        <li>Flattened nose bridge</li>
        <li>Short neck</li>
        <li>Small hands with short fingers</li>
        <li>
          Fewer palm creases, including one across the palm and one around the
          base of the thumb
        </li>
        <li>Short height</li>
        <li>Loose joints</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Not all children with Down syndrome will have these features. Additional
        health issues may include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Heart defects</li>
        <li>Intestinal problems</li>
        <li>Vision and hearing problems</li>
        <li>Thyroid problems</li>
        <li>
          Blood conditions, such as leukemia, and increased risk of infections
        </li>
        <li>Learning difficulties</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>

      <p>
        Down syndrome can often be diagnosed before birth through tests on cells
        from the amniotic fluid or placenta or by analyzing the baby's DNA in
        the mother’s blood. Fetal ultrasounds may also suggest the condition,
        though they are not 100% accurate.
      </p>

      <p>
        After birth, Down syndrome may be diagnosed with a physical exam, and a
        blood test can confirm the presence of an extra chromosome.
      </p>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>

      <p>
        There is no cure for Down syndrome, but treatment can address specific
        problems such as:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Heart defects:</b> About half of babies with Down syndrome have
          heart defects, some treatable with medication and others requiring
          surgery.
        </li>
        <li><b>Intestinal problems:</b> Some require surgery.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Vision problems:</b> Correctable with glasses, surgery, or other
          treatments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Hearing loss:</b> Due to fluid in the middle ear or nerve defects,
          regular hearing tests are essential for early treatment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Other health problems:</b> Children with Down syndrome may
          experience thyroid issues, leukemia, and frequent colds or infections.
          Regular medical care and vaccinations are important.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Learning difficulties:</b> Ranging from mild to moderate, early
          intervention and special education can help children reach their
          potential.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Some suggest high-dose vitamins improve learning and development in
        children with Down syndrome, but no studies have confirmed this.
      </p>

      <h2>Complications</h2>

      <p>
        Complications of Down syndrome vary depending on the severity and the
        body systems affected. Treatment varies accordingly, and healthcare
        providers will discuss appropriate options with you.
      </p>

      <h2>Prevention</h2>

      <p>
        Researchers do not know how to prevent the chromosome errors that cause
        Down syndrome, and there is no reason to believe a parent can cause or
        prevent it. However, for women who have already had a child with Down
        syndrome, the risk of having another child with the condition depends on
        various factors, including age.
      </p>

      <h2>Living with Down Syndrome</h2>

      <p>
        Children with Down syndrome can typically do most things other children
        can do, though they may achieve developmental milestones later. Early
        intervention programs are important to help them reach their potential.
      </p>

      <p>
        Children with Down syndrome can attend school and take part in special
        programs to develop skills as fully as possible. Many children will
        learn to read, write, and participate in activities in school and their
        communities. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy may be necessary
        to assist their development.
      </p>

      <p>
        Adults with Down syndrome can often work, live semi-independently, and
        participate in the community. Some may marry, but most men with Down
        syndrome cannot father a child, and women with Down syndrome have a 50%
        chance of conceiving a child with the condition, though many pregnancies
        are miscarried.
      </p>
