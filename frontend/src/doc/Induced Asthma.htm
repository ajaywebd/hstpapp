      <h1>Exercise-Induced Asthma</h1>
      <p>
        Most kids and teens with asthma have symptoms when they exercise.
        However, some people, including those without asthma, have asthma
        symptoms only during or after exercise. This is known as
        exercise-induced asthma (EIA), also called exercise-induced
        bronchoconstriction (EIB).
      </p>

      <h2>Signs & Symptoms of EIA</h2>
      <p>
        Symptoms of exercise-induced asthma include wheezing, tightness or pain
        in the chest, coughing, and in some cases, lasting shortness of breath.
      </p>
      <p>Someone with EIA may:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Get winded or tired easily during or after exercise</b></li>
        <li><b>Cough after coming inside from being active outdoors</b></li>
        <li>
          <b>Not be able to run for more than a few minutes without stopping</b>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Kids with EIA often begin having symptoms 5–10 minutes after starting to
        exercise (though some kids only get them after they stop being active).
        Symptoms usually peak 5–10 minutes after stopping the activity and may
        take an hour or longer to end.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, there's a difference between someone with exercise-induced
        asthma and someone who's out of shape and winded. It takes much longer
        for someone with EIA to recover. Temperature extremes, especially cold
        weather, can make it even worse.
      </p>

      <h2>Causes</h2>
      <p>
        Inhaling cold, dry air during exercise is thought to be the main cause
        of EIA symptoms. When kids exercise or play hard, they tend to breathe
        quickly, shallowly, and through the mouth. The air reaching their lungs
        misses the warming and humidifying effects that happen when they breathe
        more slowly through the nose. The cool, dry air makes the airways in the
        lungs narrower, blocking the flow of air and making it harder to
        breathe. This is called bronchoconstriction.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's important to remember that staying fit and exercising regularly can
        actually help reduce asthma symptoms. Kids and teens with asthma should
        exercise as much as they can.
      </p>

      <h2>How Is EIA Diagnosed?</h2>
      <p>
        A doctor will ask about the family's asthma and allergy history, the
        symptoms, and what has triggered them in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        After taking a medical history and doing a physical exam, the doctor may
        ask your child to take a breathing test after exercising. This can be
        done in the office on a treadmill, after your child runs outside for 6
        to 8 minutes, or after doing an activity that triggered flare-ups in the
        past.
      </p>

      <h2>How Is EIA Treated?</h2>
      <p>
        Doctors sometimes recommend pretreatment for EIA. This means taking
        medicine before exercising or being very active. The medicine is often
        the same quick-relief medicine used during flare-ups. Taking it before
        exercise can help prevent the airway narrowing triggered by exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
        If pretreatment doesn't control symptoms, the doctor may recommend using
        long-term control medicine (also called controller or maintenance
        medicine). This asthma medicine is usually taken regularly over time to
        reduce airway inflammation.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your child still has breathing trouble during exercise, let the
        doctor know. The medicine dosages may need to be adjusted for better
        control.
      </p>

      <h2>Which Activities Are OK for Kids With EIA?</h2>
      <p>
        Exercise is a great idea for everyone, including kids with
        exercise-induced asthma. Besides keeping kids fit, exercise can improve
        lung function by strengthening the breathing muscles in the chest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Encourage your child to be active while keeping asthma symptoms under
        control by following the asthma action plan. Ask your doctor which
        exercises, sports, and activities are safe for your child.
      </p>
      <p>These activities usually are OK for people with EIA:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Easy walking, jogging, or hiking</li>
        <li>Golf</li>
        <li>Baseball</li>
        <li>Football</li>
        <li>Gymnastics</li>
        <li>Shorter track and field events</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Endurance sports (like long-distance running or cycling) and those
        requiring extended energy output (like soccer and basketball) can be
        more challenging. Cold-weather sports, like cross-country skiing and ice
        hockey, can also be difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, many athletes with asthma have found that with proper training
        and medicine, they can do any sport they choose.
      </p>

      <h2>Tips for Kids With Exercise-Induced Asthma</h2>
      <p>
        For the most part, kids with exercise-induced asthma can do anything
        their peers can do. Be sure to follow the suggestions given by your
        child's doctor.
      </p>
      <p>Here are some tips for kids and teens:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If symptoms start, don't exercise until they stop.</li>
        <li>
          Warm up before exercise to prevent chest tightening. (Warm-up
          exercises can include 5–10 minutes of walking or any other light
          activity, plus stretching or flexibility exercises.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Take quick-relief medicine as close to the start of exercise as
          possible.
        </li>
        <li>Breathe through the nose during exercise.</li>
        <li>
          Take brief rests during exercise and use quick-relief medicine, as
          prescribed, if symptoms start.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cool down after exercise to help slow the change of air temperature in
          the lungs.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It's also best not to exercise outside during very cold weather. If your
        child plays outside in the cold, wearing a ski mask or a scarf over the
        mouth and nose should help.
      </p>
      <p>
        If air pollution or pollen are triggers, your child may want to exercise
        indoors when air quality is poor or pollen counts are high. Kids
        shouldn't exercise when they have a cold or other upper respiratory
        infection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kids should always have access to their quick-relief medicine. Keep
        extras on hand and be sure to check all supplies so your child isn't
        carrying an empty inhaler.
