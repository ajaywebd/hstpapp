      <h1><b>Congenital heart defects</b></h1>

      <p>
        If your child has a congenital heart defect, it means that your child
        was born with a problem in the structure of his or her heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some congenital heart defects in children are simple and don't need
        treatment. Other congenital heart defects in children are more complex
        and may require several surgeries performed over a period of several
        years.
      </p>

      <p>
        Learning about your child's congenital heart defect can help you
        understand the condition and know what you can expect in the coming
        months and years.
      </p>

      <p><b>Symptoms</b></p>

      <p>
        Serious congenital heart defects usually become evident soon after birth
        or during the first few months of life. Signs and symptoms could
        include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Pale gray or blue skin color (cyanosis)</li>
        <li>Rapid breathing</li>
        <li>Swelling in the legs, abdomen, or areas around the eyes</li>
        <li>
          Shortness of breath during feedings, leading to poor weight gain
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Less serious congenital heart defects may not be diagnosed until later
        in childhood. If signs and symptoms are evident in older children, they
        may include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Easily becoming short of breath during exercise or activity</li>
        <li>Easily tiring during exercise or activity</li>
        <li>Fainting during exercise or activity</li>
        <li>Swelling in the hands, ankles, or feet</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>How the heart works</b></p>

      <p>
        The heart is divided into four hollow chambers, two on the right and two
        on the left. To pump blood throughout the body, the heart uses its left
        and right sides for different tasks.
      </p>

      <p>
        The right side of the heart moves blood to the lungs through vessels
        called pulmonary arteries. In the lungs, blood picks up oxygen then
        returns to the heart's left side through the pulmonary veins. The left
        side of the heart then pumps the blood through the aorta and out to the
        rest of the body.
      </p>

      <p><b>How heart defects develop</b></p>

      <p>
        During the first six weeks of pregnancy, the heart begins taking shape
        and starts beating. The major blood vessels that run to and from the
        heart also begin to form during this critical time during gestation.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's at this point in your baby's development that heart defects may
        begin to develop. Researchers aren't sure exactly what causes most of
        these defects, but they think genetics, certain medical conditions, some
        medications, and environmental factors, such as smoking, may play a
        role.
      </p>

      <p><b>Types of heart defects</b></p>

      <p>
        There are many different types of congenital heart defects, falling
        mainly into these categories:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Holes in the heart</b>. These can form in the walls between major
          blood vessels leaving the heart. A ventricular septal defect is a hole
          in the wall between the right and left ventricles. An atrial septal
          defect occurs when there's a hole between the atria.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Obstructed blood flow</b>. When blood vessels or heart valves are
          narrow, the heart must work harder to pump blood, leading to heart
          enlargement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Abnormal blood vessels</b>. Congenital heart defects can occur when
          blood vessels going to and from the heart don't form correctly or are
          not positioned properly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Heart valve abnormalities</b>. If the heart valves can't open and
          close correctly, blood flow is restricted.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>An underdeveloped heart</b>. In conditions like hypoplastic left
          heart syndrome, the left side of the heart hasn't developed enough to
          pump blood effectively.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>A combination of defects</b>. Tetralogy of Fallot is a combination
          of four defects: a hole between ventricles, a narrowed passage to the
          pulmonary artery, a shift in the connection of the aorta, and
          thickened right ventricular muscle.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Risk factors</b></p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Rubella (German measles)</b>. Having rubella during pregnancy can
          cause problems in your baby's heart development.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Diabetes</b>. Controlling your diabetes before and during pregnancy
          can reduce the risk of congenital heart defects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Medications</b>. Certain medications taken during pregnancy can
          increase the risk of congenital heart defects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Drinking alcohol during pregnancy</b>. Avoid alcohol during
          pregnancy as it increases the risk of heart defects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Smoking</b>. Smoking during pregnancy increases the likelihood of
          congenital heart defects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Heredity</b>. Congenital heart defects sometimes run in families
          and may be associated with genetic syndromes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Diagnosis</b></p>

      <p>
        If it's possible your child has a heart defect, your doctor may order
        several tests, including:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Fetal echocardiogram</b>. This test allows your doctor to see if
          your child has a heart defect before he or she is born, using an
          ultrasound to create a picture of the baby's heart.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Echocardiogram</b>. This test, performed after birth, uses
          ultrasound to produce images of the heart, allowing the doctor to see
          any abnormalities in the heart muscle and valves.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Electrocardiogram</b>. This test records the electrical activity of
          your child’s heart and helps diagnose rhythm problems or other
          defects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Chest X-ray</b>. A chest X-ray can show if the heart is enlarged or
          if there is extra blood or fluid in the lungs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Pulse oximetry</b>. This non-invasive test measures how much oxygen
          is in your child’s blood using a sensor placed over the child’s
          finger.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cardiac catheterization</b>. A thin, flexible tube is inserted into
          a blood vessel and guided to the heart. This test gives detailed
          information about the heart defect and sometimes allows for treatment
          during the procedure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</b>. MRI technology
          provides a detailed image of the heart and is increasingly used to
          evaluate congenital heart defects in adolescents and adults.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Treatment</b></p>

      <p>
        A congenital heart defect may not require long-term treatment, and in
        some instances, defects can correct themselves as the child grows.
        However, some defects are serious and require immediate treatment. The
        treatments include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Procedures using catheterization</b>. Some defects can be repaired
          using catheterization techniques, avoiding open-heart surgery. A
          catheter is inserted into a vein and guided to the heart where tools
          can repair the defect.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Open-heart surgery</b>. Some defects require surgery to repair the
          heart. In some cases, minimally invasive heart surgery is an option.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Heart transplant</b>. In severe cases, a heart transplant may be
          necessary if the defect cannot be repaired.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Medications</b>. Medications can help the heart work more
          efficiently and treat symptoms such as high blood pressure and fluid
          retention. Some medications are prescribed to manage irregular
          heartbeats (arrhythmias).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Long-term treatment</b></p>

      <p>
        Some children with congenital heart defects require multiple procedures
        and surgeries throughout their lives. Lifelong monitoring by
        cardiologists is necessary even after corrective surgery. As the child
        grows older, care will transition to an adult congenital cardiologist,
        as congenital heart defects can affect adult life.
      </p>

      <p><b>Exercise restrictions</b></p>

      <p>
        Although some children may need to limit physical activity, many can
        participate in normal or near-normal activities. Parents should work
        with doctors to determine which activities are safe for their child.
      </p>

      <p><b>Infection prevention</b></p>

      <p>
        Depending on the type of congenital heart defect and the surgery used to
        correct it, your child may need to take extra steps to prevent
        infections, such as taking antibiotics before certain medical or dental
        procedures to prevent infective endocarditis.
      </p>

      <p><b>Complications</b></p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Congestive heart failure</b>. This can develop in babies with
          significant heart defects. Signs include rapid breathing and poor
          weight gain.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Slower growth and development</b>. Children with serious heart
          defects may develop and grow more slowly than other children.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Heart rhythm problems</b>. Arrhythmias can be caused by congenital
          heart defects or scarring after surgery.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cyanosis</b>. Some children with heart defects may develop a
          grayish-blue skin color due to oxygen-poor blood mixing with
          oxygen-rich blood.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Stroke</b>. Some children with congenital heart defects are at
          higher risk of stroke due to blood clots traveling through a hole in
          the heart to the brain.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Emotional issues</b>. Children with congenital heart defects may
          feel insecure or develop emotional problems due to activity
          restrictions or learning difficulties.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Prevention</b></p>

      <p>
        While it’s not always possible to prevent congenital heart defects,
        there are things you can do to reduce the risk:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Get a rubella (German measles) vaccine</b>. Be vaccinated before
          trying to conceive.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Control chronic medical conditions</b>. Manage diabetes and other
          chronic conditions to reduce the risk of heart defects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Avoid harmful substances</b>. Avoid exposure to harmful substances
          like alcohol, tobacco, and certain medications during pregnancy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Take a multivitamin with folic acid</b>. Daily consumption of 400
          micrograms of folic acid has been shown to reduce the risk of birth
          defects, including heart defects.
        </li>
      </ul>
