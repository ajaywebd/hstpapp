      <h1>Ebola</h1>

      <p>
        Ebola is a serious and deadly virus transmitted by animals and humans.
        It was initially detected in 1976 in Sudan and the Democratic Republic
        of Congo. Researchers named the disease after the Ebola River. Until
        recently, Ebola appeared only in Africa.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although the Ebola virus has been present for more than 35 years, the
        largest outbreak began in West Africa in March 2014. This outbreak has
        proven more deadly, severe, and widespread than previous outbreaks.
        While cases have significantly declined since the peak of the outbreak,
        there's still a chance of further outbreaks. Learning the facts about
        the virus can help prevent the spread of this deadly infection.
      </p>

      <h2>Causes</h2>

      <p>
        The Ebola virus belongs to the viral family <b>Filoviridae</b>, also
        known as <b>Filovirus</b>. These viruses cause hemorrhagic fever or
        profuse bleeding inside and outside the body, accompanied by a high
        fever. Ebola can be further divided into subtypes, which are named for
        the locations where they were identified, including:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Bundibugyo</li>
        <li>Reston</li>
        <li>Sudan</li>
        <li>Ta√Ø Forest (previously known as Ivory Coast)</li>
        <li>Zaire</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The Ebola virus likely originated in African fruit bats. It is
        classified as a zoonotic virus because it is transmitted to humans from
        animals. Humans can also transfer the virus to one another. The
        following animals can transmit the virus:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Chimpanzees</li>
        <li>Forest antelopes</li>
        <li>Gorillas</li>
        <li>Monkeys</li>
        <li>Porcupines</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        People may handle infected animals, which can transmit the virus via
        blood and body fluids.
      </p>

      <h2>Risk Factors</h2>

      <p>
        Unlike some other viruses, Ebola cannot be transmitted through the air
        or by touch alone. Direct contact with bodily fluids from an infected
        person is required for transmission. Ebola can be spread through:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Blood</li>
        <li>Diarrhea</li>
        <li>Breast milk</li>
        <li>Feces</li>
        <li>Saliva</li>
        <li>Semen</li>
        <li>Sweat</li>
        <li>Urine</li>
        <li>Vomit</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These bodily fluids can carry the Ebola virus, and transmission can
        occur via the eyes, nose, mouth, broken skin, or sexual contact.
        Healthcare workers are especially at risk due to their exposure to
        infected blood and fluids.
      </p>

      <p>Other risk factors include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Exposure to infected objects, such as needles</li>
        <li>Interactions with infected animals</li>
        <li>Attending burial ceremonies of someone who died from Ebola</li>
        <li>Traveling to areas where a recent outbreak has occurred</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>

      <p>
        According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Ebola
        symptoms typically appear within 8 to 10 days after exposure, though
        they can appear as early as 2 days or as late as 3 weeks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Extreme fatigue is often the first prominent symptom. Other symptoms
        include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Diarrhea</li>
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Headache</li>
        <li>Muscle pain</li>
        <li>Stomach pain</li>
        <li>Unexplained bleeding or bruising</li>
        <li>Vomiting</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you have come in contact with someone diagnosed with Ebola or handled
        infected animals and have any of these symptoms, you should seek
        immediate medical attention.
      </p>

      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>

      <p>
        The early symptoms of Ebola can closely mimic other diseases such as the
        flu, malaria, and typhoid fever. Blood tests can identify antibodies of
        the Ebola virus, along with other indicators such as:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Low or high white blood cell counts</li>
        <li>Low platelet counts</li>
        <li>Elevated liver enzymes</li>
        <li>Abnormal coagulation factor levels</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If no symptoms appear within 21 days after exposure, Ebola is ruled out.
      </p>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>

      <p>
        There is no specific cure or vaccine for Ebola at this time. Supportive
        care is provided to manage symptoms, including:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Giving medications to maintain blood pressure</li>
        <li>Managing electrolyte balances</li>
        <li>Providing extra oxygen, if needed</li>
        <li>Providing intravenous or oral fluids to prevent dehydration</li>
        <li>Treating coexisting infections</li>
        <li>Administering blood products if indicated</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Prevention</h2>

      <p>Preventive measures include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Avoiding contact with blood and body fluids</li>
        <li>
          Practicing careful hand hygiene with soap and water or alcohol-based
          hand sanitizers
        </li>
        <li>
          Refraining from handling items a person with Ebola has touched,
          including clothing, bedding, needles, or medical equipment
        </li>
        <li>
          Wearing protective clothing when in contact with wildlife or infected
          individuals
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Healthcare workers and lab technicians must take precautions such as
        wearing protective gowns, gloves, masks, and eye shields when handling
        Ebola patients or their belongings.
      </p>

      <h2>Complications</h2>

      <p>
        Some people recover from Ebola without complications, but others may
        experience lingering effects, including:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Joint problems</li>
        <li>Hair loss</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Delirium</li>
        <li>Inflammation of the liver and eyes</li>
        <li>Sensory changes</li>
        <li>Jaundice</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Severe complications include multiple organ failure, coma, shock, and
        severe bleeding.
      </p>

      <h2>Outlook</h2>

      <p>
        According to the WHO, the average fatality rate for Ebola is 50%, though
        some virus strains are deadlier than others. The earlier the infection
        is diagnosed, the better the outlook for recovery.
      </p>

      <p>
        The CDC estimates that Ebola survivors have antibodies to the virus for
        about 10 years. Until a vaccine is available, it is important to remain
        cautious to avoid the spread of the virus.
