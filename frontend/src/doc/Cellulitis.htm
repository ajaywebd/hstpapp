      <h1><b>Cellulitis</b></h1>

      <p>
        Cellulitis is a common bacterial skin infection. It may first appear as
        a red, swollen area that feels hot and tender to the touch. The redness
        and swelling often spread rapidly, and cellulitis is usually painful.
      </p>

      <p>
        In most cases, the skin on the lower legs is affected, although the
        infection can occur anywhere on your body or face. Cellulitis usually
        affects the surface of your skin but may also affect the underlying
        tissues of your skin. It can also spread to your lymph nodes and
        bloodstream.
      </p>

      <p>
        If cellulitis isn’t treated, the infection might spread and become
        life-threatening. You should get medical help right away if you
        experience symptoms of cellulitis.
      </p>

      <p><b>Symptoms</b></p>

      <p>The symptoms of cellulitis may include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>pain and tenderness in the affected area</li>
        <li>redness or inflammation of your skin</li>
        <li>a skin sore or rash that appears and grows quickly</li>
        <li>a tight, glossy, swollen appearance of the skin</li>
        <li>a feeling of warmth in the affected area</li>
        <li>a central area that has an abscess with pus formation</li>
        <li>a fever</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Some common symptoms of a more serious cellulitis infection are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>shaking</li>
        <li>chills</li>
        <li>a feeling of illness</li>
        <li>fatigue</li>
        <li>dizziness</li>
        <li>lightheadedness</li>
        <li>muscle aches</li>
        <li>warm skin</li>
        <li>sweating</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Symptoms that could signal that cellulitis is spreading:</b></p>

      <ul>
        <li>drowsiness</li>
        <li>lethargy</li>
        <li>blistering</li>
        <li>red streaks</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You should contact your doctor immediately if any of these symptoms
        occur.
      </p>

      <p><b>Causes and Risk Factors</b></p>

      <p>
        Cellulitis occurs when certain types of bacteria enter through a cut or
        crack in the skin. It is commonly caused by <b>Staphylococcus</b> and
        <b>Streptococcus</b> bacteria.
      </p>

      <p>
        Skin injuries such as cuts, insect bites, or surgical incisions are
        commonly the sites of infection. Certain factors increase the risk of
        developing cellulitis.
      </p>

      <p><b>Common risk factors include:</b></p>

      <ul>
        <li>a weakened immune system</li>
        <li>
          skin conditions that cause breaks in the skin, such as eczema and
          athlete’s foot
        </li>
        <li>intravenous (IV) drug use</li>
        <li>diabetes</li>
        <li>a history of cellulitis</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Diagnosis</b></p>

      <p>
        Your doctor can usually diagnose cellulitis on sight, but they’ll
        perform a physical exam to determine the extent of your condition. This
        exam might reveal:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>swelling of the skin</li>
        <li>redness and warmth of the affected area</li>
        <li>swollen glands</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Depending on the severity of your symptoms, your doctor may want to
        monitor the affected area for a few days to see if redness or swelling
        spread. In some cases, your doctor may perform a blood test or a culture
        of the wound to test for the presence of bacteria.
      </p>

      <p><b>Treatment</b></p>

      <p>
        Your doctor will usually prescribe a 10- to 21-day regimen of oral
        antibiotics to treat cellulitis. The length of treatment depends on the
        severity of your condition. Even if symptoms improve within a few days,
        it’s important to take all of the prescribed medication to ensure proper
        treatment. Monitor your condition to see if symptoms improve, and in
        most cases, they will improve or disappear within a few days.
      </p>

      <p>
        In some cases, pain relievers are prescribed. You should rest until
        symptoms improve. While resting, raise the affected limb higher than
        your heart to reduce swelling.
      </p>

      <p>
        Contact your doctor immediately if you don’t respond to treatment within
        three days, if symptoms worsen, or if you develop a fever.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cellulitis should go away within seven to 10 days of starting
        antibiotics. Longer treatment may be necessary if the infection is
        severe or if you have a chronic disease or compromised immune system.
      </p>

      <p>
        People with certain pre-existing conditions may need to stay in the
        hospital for observation. Your doctor may advise hospitalization if you:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>have a high temperature</li>
        <li>have high blood pressure</li>
        <li>have an infection that doesn’t improve with antibiotics</li>
        <li>have a compromised immune system</li>
        <li>require IV antibiotics when oral antibiotics don’t work</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Possible complications</b></p>

      <p>
        Sometimes cellulitis can spread throughout the body, entering the lymph
        nodes and bloodstream. In rare cases, it can enter deeper tissue layers.
        Possible complications include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>a blood infection</li>
        <li>a bone infection</li>
        <li>inflammation of your lymph vessels</li>
        <li>tissue death, or gangrene</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Preventing cellulitis</b></p>

      <p>
        If you have a break in your skin, clean it immediately and apply
        antibiotic ointment regularly. Cover the wound with a bandage and change
        it daily until a scab forms. Watch for redness, drainage, or pain, which
        may indicate infection. People with poor circulation or pre-existing
        conditions should take extra precautions, including:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>keeping skin moist to prevent cracking</li>
        <li>
          promptly treating superficial skin infections, such as athlete's foot
        </li>
        <li>wearing protective equipment when working or playing</li>
        <li>inspecting feet daily for signs of injury or infection</li>
      </ul>
