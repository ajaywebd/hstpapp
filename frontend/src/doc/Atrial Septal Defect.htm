      <h1>Atrial Septal Defect (ASD)</h1>
      <p>
        An atrial septal defect is an opening in the atrial septum, or dividing
        wall between the two upper chambers of the heart, known as the right and
        left atria. ASD can be a congenital (present at birth) heart defect, or
        it can result from the failure of normal postnatal closure of a hole
        that is present in the heart of every fetus.
      </p>

      <p>
        Normally, oxygen-poor (blue) blood returns to the right atrium from the
        body, travels to the right ventricle, then is pumped into the lungs
        where it receives oxygen. Oxygen-rich (red) blood returns to the left
        atrium from the lungs, passes into the left ventricle, and then is
        pumped out to the body through the aorta.
      </p>

      <p>
        An atrial septal defect allows oxygen-rich (red) blood to pass from the
        left atrium, through the opening in the septum, and then mix with
        oxygen-poor (blue) blood in the right atrium.
      </p>

      <p>
        Atrial septal defects occur in a small percentage of children born with
        congenital heart disease. For unknown reasons, girls have atrial septal
        defects twice as often as boys.
      </p>

      <h2>Causes</h2>
      <p>
        The heart is forming during the first eight weeks of fetal development.
        It begins as a hollow tube, then partitions within the tube develop that
        eventually become the septa (or walls) dividing the right side of the
        heart from the left. Atrial septal defects usually occur when the
        partitioning process does not occur completely, leaving an opening in
        the atrial septum.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some congenital heart defects may have a genetic link, either occurring
        due to a defect in a gene, a chromosome abnormality, or environmental
        exposure, causing heart problems to occur more often in certain
        families. Most atrial septal defects occur sporadically (by chance),
        with no clear reason for their development.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Atrial Septal Defects</h2>
      <p>There are four major types of atrial septal defects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Ostium secundum atrial septal defect:</strong> This is the
          most common atrial septal defect, affecting over two-thirds of people
          with atrial septal defects. It is caused when a part of the atrial
          septum fails to close completely while the heart is developing. This
          causes an opening to develop in the center of the wall separating the
          two atria.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ostium primum atrial septal defect:</strong> This defect is
          part of atrioventricular canal defects, and is associated with a split
          (cleft) in one of the leaflets of the mitral valve.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sinus venosus atrial septal defect:</strong> This defect
          occurs at the superior vena cava and right atrium junction, in the
          area where the right pulmonary veins enter the heart. As a result, the
          drainage of one or more of the pulmonary veins may be abnormal in that
          the pulmonary veins drain to the right atrium, rather than the left
          atrium.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Coronary sinus atrial septal defect:</strong> This defect is
          located within the wall of the coronary sinus, where it passes behind
          the left atrium. The coronary sinus carries the blood flow from the
          heart's own vein into the right atrium. It is the rarest of all atrial
          septal defects.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why is an Atrial Septal Defect a Concern?</h2>
      <p>
        This heart defect can over time cause lung problems if not repaired.
        When blood passes through the ASD from the left atrium to the right
        atrium, a larger volume of blood than normal must be handled by the
        right side of the heart. This extra blood passes through the pulmonary
        artery into the lungs, causing higher amounts of blood flow than normal
        in the vessels in the lungs.
      </p>

      <p>
        A small opening in the atrial septum allows a small amount of blood to
        pass through from the left atrium to the right atrium. A large opening
        allows more blood to pass through and mix with the normal blood flow in
        the right heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        The lungs are able to cope with this extra blood flow for a long period
        of time. In some patients, the extra blood flow eventually raises the
        blood pressure in the lungs, usually after several decades. This then
        hardens the blood vessels in the lungs, causing them to be diseased,
        resulting in irreversible changes in the lungs.
      </p>

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>
      <p>
        Many children have no symptoms and seem healthy. However, if the ASD is
        large, permitting a large amount of blood to pass through to the right
        side of the heart, the right atrium, right ventricle, and lungs will
        become overworked, and symptoms may be noted. Symptoms may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Child tires easily when playing</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Sweating</li>
        <li>Rapid breathing</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath</li>
        <li>Poor growth</li>
        <li>Frequent respiratory infections</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to a complete medical history and physical examination,
        several procedures can be used to diagnose atrial septal defects,
        including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG):</strong> An ECG measures the
          electrical activity of the heart. Electrodes are placed on the body to
          obtain a picture of this activity. The test can show the presence of
          arrhythmias or other heart conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Resting ECG:</strong> During this test, the patient lies down
          while electrodes record the heartâ€™s electrical activity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Exercise ECG (stress test):</strong> During this test, the
          patient exercises (walking on a treadmill or pedaling a bicycle) while
          the heart's electrical activity is recorded.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Holter monitor:</strong> This test records the heart's
          electrical activity for 24 or more hours during normal daily
          activities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Electrophysiologic study (EPS):</strong> This invasive test
          uses a catheter inserted into a large blood vessel to study the
          heart's electrical system and find the site of arrhythmias.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
      <p>
        Treatment will depend on the child's symptoms, age, and general health.
        The most common type of ASD may close on its own as the child grows. If
        the ASD doesn't close, treatments may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Medication:</strong> Some children may need medication to help
          the heart function more effectively.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Surgery:</strong> The defect may be closed surgically with
          stitches or a patch.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Device closure:</strong> A septal occluder may be inserted via
          cardiac catheterization to close the ASD without surgery.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Living with Atrial Septal Defect</h2>
      <p>
        Children with ASD should be cared for by a pediatric cardiologist. Most
        children who have ASD repair live healthy lives, though some may need
        antibiotics to prevent bacterial endocarditis. Early diagnosis and
        repair of ASD improve outcomes, and children rarely require extensive
        follow-up care unless complications occur.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An atrial septal defect is an opening in the wall dividing the two
          upper chambers of the heart.
        </li>
        <li>
          Symptoms include tiredness, fast breathing, shortness of breath, poor
          growth, arrhythmias, and frequent respiratory infections.
        </li>
        <li>
          Small ASDs may close on their own, while larger ones may need surgical
          repair.
        </li>
        <li>Most children with ASD repair live healthy lives.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Danger Signs</h2>
      <p>
        Call your healthcare provider if your child experiences worsening
        symptoms, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Increased tiredness</li>
        <li>Difficulty breathing</li>
        <li>Fast breathing</li>
        <li>Racing heartbeat or palpitations</li>
      </ul>
