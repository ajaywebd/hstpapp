      <h1>Anemia</h1>

      <p>
        Anemia is a common blood disorder that occurs when the body has fewer
        red blood cells than normal. Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the
        body using a protein called hemoglobin. If there aren’t enough of these
        cells or this protein, anemia results.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anemia is often a symptom of a disease rather than a disease itself. In
        some cases, anemia is temporary and caused by a nutritional deficiency
        or blood loss. In others, it’s the result of a chronic or inherited
        condition, including genetic disorders, autoimmune problems, cancers,
        and other diseases. While many types of anemia can be mild and easily
        corrected, certain types of anemia can be severe, chronic, and/or
        life-threatening.
      </p>

      <p>Types of anemia include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Iron deficiency anemia</li>
        <li>Iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA)</li>
        <li>Congenital sideroblastic anemia</li>
        <li>Megaloblastic anemia</li>
        <li>Hemolytic anemia</li>
        <li>Sickle cell anemia</li>
        <li>Thalassemia</li>
        <li>Aplastic anemia</li>
        <li>Fanconi anemia</li>
        <li>Diamond-Blackfan anemia</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Symptoms and Causes</h2>

      <p>
        Each child may experience anemia symptoms differently. Some of the
        symptoms included are specific to certain causes of anemia but most are
        non-specific. Anemia can also be a symptom associated with other
        diseases. The most frequently noted anemia symptoms include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Pale skin, lips, hands or under the eyelids</li>
        <li>Increased heart rate (tachycardia)</li>
        <li>Breathlessness, or difficulty catching a breath (dyspnea)</li>
        <li>Lack of energy, or tiring easily (fatigue)</li>
        <li>Dizziness, or vertigo, especially upon standing</li>
        <li>Headache</li>
        <li>Irritability</li>
        <li>Irregular menstruation cycles</li>
        <li>Absent or delayed menstruation (amenorrhea)</li>
        <li>Sore or swollen tongue (glossitis)</li>
        <li>Jaundice, or yellowing of skin, eyes, and mouth</li>
        <li>Enlarged spleen or liver (splenomegaly, hepatomegaly)</li>
        <li>Slow or delayed growth and development</li>
        <li>Impaired wound and tissue healing</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        It is important to understand that some symptoms of anemia may resemble
        those of other more common medical problems. Because some of these
        symptoms can also point to other conditions, and because anemia itself
        can be a symptom of another medical problem, it’s important to have your
        child evaluated by a qualified medical professional for an accurate
        diagnosis and prompt treatment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anemia's causes are largely dependent on the type of anemia your child
        suffers from. The most common causes include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Nutritional deficiencies (iron, folic acid, or vitamin B12)</li>
        <li>
          Inherited diseases (e.g., Fanconi anemia, thalassemia, sickle cell
          anemia)
        </li>
        <li>Autoimmune diseases</li>
        <li>Bleeding</li>
        <li>Certain cancerous conditions</li>
        <li>Certain medications</li>
        <li>Infections</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>

      <p>
        The first step in treating your child is forming an accurate and
        complete diagnosis. Anemia is usually discovered during a medical exam
        through simple blood tests that measure the concentration of hemoglobin
        and the number of red blood cells. Diagnostic procedures to determine
        the underlying cause of the anemia may include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Complete medical history and physical examination</li>
        <li>
          Measurement of hematocrit, the percent of red blood cells found in a
          specific volume of blood
        </li>
        <li>
          Hemoglobin electrophoresis to determine the amount and type of
          hemoglobin in the blood
        </li>
        <li>Additional blood tests</li>
        <li>Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        There may be other diagnostic tests that your doctor will discuss with
        you depending on your child's individual situation. After we complete
        all necessary tests, our experts meet to review and discuss what they
        have learned about your child’s condition. Then we will meet with you
        and your family to discuss the results and outline the best possible
        treatment options.
      </p>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>

      <p>
        Depending on the specific cause of your child’s anemia, your child’s
        physician may recommend a variety of different treatments. Treatments
        for various forms of anemia may include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Vitamin and mineral supplements</li>
        <li>Change in your child’s diet</li>
        <li>Medication and/or discontinuing causative medications</li>
        <li>Treatment of the underlying disorder</li>
        <li>
          Surgery to remove the spleen (if related to certain hemolytic anemias)
        </li>
        <li>Blood transfusions, if necessary (to replace significant loss)</li>
        <li>Antibiotics (as appropriate if infection is the cause)</li>
        <li>
          Stem cell transplant (for bone marrow failure, such as aplastic
          anemia, Fanconi anemia, or Diamond-Blackfan anemia)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Long-Term Outlook</h2>

      <p>
        The long-term outlook for children with anemia depends on the specific
        cause of the anemia. Some forms of anemia, such as a nutritional
        deficiency, can be treated quickly and don’t require significant
        long-term follow-up care.
      </p>

      <p>
        In other cases, in which the anemia is caused by a genetic condition or
        other serious underlying disorder, your child may need regular follow-up
        by our hematologists. Your child’s physician can discuss your child’s
        specific care plan.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have a number of resources at Dana-Farber/Boston Children’s to help
        you and your family through this time. From the first visit through
        follow-up care, our nurses will be on hand to walk you through your
        child’s treatment and help answer any questions you may have.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’d like to talk with someone whose child has been treated for
        anemia, we can put you in touch with other families who have been
        through the same experience that you and your child are facing.
