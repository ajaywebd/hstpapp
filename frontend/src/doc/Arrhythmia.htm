      <h1>Arrhythmia</h1>
      <p>
        An arrhythmia is any change in the regular, even rhythm of the
        heartbeat. If your child has an arrhythmia, his or her heart might beat
        too fast or too slow, or it might skip a beat or have extra beats. An
        arrhythmia might result from a physical condition such as a heart defect
        or in response to outside factors, such as a fever, infection, and
        certain medications. Even crying and playing can briefly alter a child’s
        heart rate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most arrhythmias are harmless, but some can be serious and even
        life-threatening. If your child’s heart beats too fast (a condition
        known as tachycardia), or too slow (bradycardia), it might affect the
        heart’s ability to pump blood efficiently to the rest of the body.
        Irregular blood flow can damage organs, including the kidneys, liver,
        heart, and brain.
      </p>

      <h2>How does an arrhythmia occur?</h2>

      <p>
        The pumping action of the heart is powered by an electrical pathway that
        runs through the nerves in the walls of the heart. With each heartbeat,
        an electrical signal is generated and travels from the top of the heart
        to the bottom.
      </p>

      <p>
        The signal begins in a group of cells in the right atrium (the upper
        right chamber of the heart) called the sinoatrial node (SA node). From
        there, the signal travels through special pathways to stimulate the
        right and left atria, causing them to contract and send blood into the
        ventricles (the bottom chambers of the heart).
      </p>

      <p>
        The current continues through its circuit to another group of cells
        called the atrioventricular node (AV node), which is between the atria
        and the ventricles. From there, the electric current moves on to another
        pathway called the bundle of His, where the signal branches out to
        stimulate the right and left ventricles, causing them to contract and
        send blood to the lungs and the rest of the body.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the circuit is working properly, the heart beats at a regular,
        smooth pace. When something interrupts the circuit, the heartbeat can
        become irregular, and an arrhythmia occurs.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of arrhythmias</h2>

      <p>
        There are many types of arrhythmias, which can be grouped into three
        general categories: supraventricular (atrial) arrhythmias, ventricular
        arrhythmias, and bradyarrhythmias.
      </p>

      <p>Atrial arrhythmias in children include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Premature atrial contractions (PACs)</b> – early beats that start
          in the atria
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)</b> – a rapid, usually regular
          rhythm, starting from above the ventricles (SVT begins and ends
          suddenly)
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT)</b> – a rapid heart rate due
          to more than one pathway through the AV node
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Atrial fibrillation</b> – a condition in which many impulses begin
          and spread through the atria, competing for a chance to travel through
          the AV node
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Atrial flutter</b> – an arrhythmia caused by one or more rapid
          circuits in the atrium
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome</b> – a condition in which an
          electrical signal may arrive at the ventricle too quickly due to an
          extra conduction pathway or a shortcut from the atria to the
          ventricles
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Ventricular arrhythmias in children include:</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs)</b> – early extra beats
          beginning in the ventricles. These occur when the electrical signal
          starts in the ventricles, causing them to contract before receiving
          signals from the atria.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach)</b> – a life-threatening condition
          in which electrical signals start from the ventricles in a fast and
          irregular rate
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Ventricular fibrillation</b> – an irregular, disorganized firing of
          impulses from the ventricles
        </li>
        <li><b>Bradyarrhythmias</b></li>
        <li>
          <b>Sinus node dysfunction</b> – a slow heart rhythm due to an abnormal
          SA node
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Heart block</b> – a delay or complete block of the electrical
          impulse from the SA node to the ventricles
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Causes</h2>

      <p>
        An arrhythmia can occur as a result of internal factors, such as a
        disease of the heart muscle itself (cardiomyopathy) or when he or she
        was born (congenital heart disease). Other common causes of arrhythmia
        in children include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Infections</li>
        <li>Chemical imbalances</li>
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Medications</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>

      <p>
        Recognizing symptoms of an arrhythmia depends on the age and maturity of
        your child. Older children can tell you about feeling lightheaded or
        feeling their heart fluttering or "skipping beats." For infants and
        toddlers, you might notice changes such as paleness of the skin,
        irritability, and disinterest in eating. Some common symptoms of
        arrhythmias include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Weakness</li>
        <li>Tiredness</li>
        <li>Palpitations</li>
        <li>Feeling lightheaded or dizzy</li>
        <li>Fainting or near fainting</li>
        <li>Paleness</li>
        <li>Chest pain</li>
        <li>A slow heartbeat</li>
        <li>A fast heartbeat</li>
        <li>Feeling pauses between heartbeats</li>
        <li>Sweating</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath</li>
        <li>Difficulty feeding (infants)</li>
        <li>Irritability in infants</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>

      <p>
        The doctor will begin with a thorough history, including a review of
        symptoms, and a physical exam. He or she might order blood tests to rule
        out medications and infections as the cause of the arrhythmia. The
        doctor may do a test called an electrocardiogram (ECG), which records
        the heartbeat, to see if it is beating regularly. The doctor might
        consult a pediatric cardiologist, a doctor who specializes in children’s
        heart disorders.
      </p>

      <p>
        If your child does not have symptoms of arrhythmia at the time of the
        ECG, the doctor might order a different type of device to record your
        child’s heartbeat. These include portable monitors you take home with
        you that continuously record your child’s heartbeat over a period of
        days to months. Implantable monitors that can be worn for up to a year
        or more are also available.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other tests that might be needed, depending on your child’s situation,
        include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Electrophysiology tests</b> – During this test, a small, thin tube
          is inserted into a blood vessel in the leg or arm and advanced to the
          heart. This allows the doctor to find the site of the arrhythmia’s
          origin within the heart tissue.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Tilt table test</b> – This test is often used in children who have
          frequent fainting episodes. A tilt table test shows how the heart rate
          and blood pressure respond to a change in position, lying down to
          standing up.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>

      <p>
        Many arrhythmias in children are isolated occurrences and harmless and
        do not need treatment. In many cases, arrhythmia is treated by treating
        the underlying problem, such as fever.
      </p>

      <p>
        Treatment, when needed, depends on the child’s age and the type and
        cause of the arrhythmia. Treatment options include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Medicine:</b> Many arrhythmias respond to medicine and need no
          other treatment. However, medicines have side effects and have to be
          watched closely.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Radiofrequency ablation:</b> This procedure involves a cardiac
          catheterization and uses radiofrequency energy applied to the area
          where the arrhythmia begins, heating it and causing tissue death. This
          is generally used to cure many forms of tachycardia.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cardioversion:</b> This is a procedure in which an electrical shock
          is delivered to the heart to convert an irregular or fast heart rhythm
          to a normal rhythm.
        </li>
        <li><b>Implantable devices:</b></li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Pacemakers:</b> These are small devices, placed just under the
            skin, that use electrical pulses to control abnormal heart rhythm.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD):</b> These devices
            are also placed under the skin. They use electrical pulses or shocks
            to help control life-threatening arrhythmias.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          <b>Surgery:</b> A procedure called Maze surgery can be used to treat
          atrial fibrillation. During Maze surgery, the surgeon makes small cuts
          or burns in the atria to prevent the spread of disorganized signals.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Prognosis</h2>

      <p>
        Most arrhythmias in children are harmless and do not lead to significant
        health problems in the future. Even serious arrhythmias can be
        successfully treated. Depending on any underlying heart disease, the
        outlook for children with arrhythmias is positive.
      </p>

      <h2>Living With Arrhythmias</h2>

      <p>
        In many cases, arrhythmias in children are harmless. However, when
        arrhythmias occur outside of exercise and play, occur often, or last a
        long time – especially in combination with any of the symptoms listed
        above – you should take your child to a healthcare professional.
