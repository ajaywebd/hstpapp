      <h1>Eating Disorders</h1>

      <p>
        Eating disorders in children and teens cause serious changes in eating
        habits that can lead to major, even life-threatening health problems.
        The three main types of eating disorders are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Anorexia</b>: A condition in which a child refuses to eat adequate
          calories out of an intense and irrational fear of becoming fat.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Bulimia</b>: A condition in which a child grossly overeats
          (binging) and then purges the food by vomiting or using laxatives to
          prevent weight gain.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Binge eating</b>: A condition in which a child may gorge rapidly on
          food but without purging.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In children and teens, eating disorders can overlap. For example, some
        children alternate between periods of anorexia and bulimia. Eating
        disorders typically develop during adolescence or early adulthood.
        However, they can start in childhood, too. Females are much more
        vulnerable. Only an estimated 5% to 15% of people with anorexia or
        bulimia are male. With binge eating, the number rises to 35% male.
      </p>

      <h2>Causes</h2>

      <p>
        Doctors aren't certain what causes eating disorders. They suspect a
        combination of biological, behavioral, and social factors. For instance,
        young people may be influenced by cultural images that favor bodies too
        underweight to be healthy. Also, many children and teens with eating
        disorders struggle with one or more of the following problems:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Distress</li>
        <li>Fear of becoming overweight</li>
        <li>Feelings of helplessness</li>
        <li>Low self-esteem</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        To cope with these issues, children and teens may adopt harmful eating
        habits. In fact, eating disorders often go hand-in-hand with other
        psychiatric problems such as:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Anxiety disorders</li>
        <li>Depression</li>
        <li>Substance abuse</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Dangers of Eating Disorders</h2>

      <p>
        Eating disorders in children and teens can lead to a host of serious
        physical problems and even death. If you spot any of the signs of the
        eating disorders listed below, call your child's doctor right away.
        Eating disorders are not overcome through sheer willpower. Your child
        will need treatment to help restore normal weight and eating habits.
        Treatment also addresses underlying psychological issues. Remember that
        the best results occur when eating disorders are treated at the earliest
        stages.
      </p>

      <h3>Anorexia in Children and Teens</h3>

      <p>
        Children and teens with anorexia have a distorted body image. People
        with anorexia view themselves as heavy, even when they are dangerously
        skinny. They are obsessed with being thin and refuse to maintain even a
        minimally normal weight.
      </p>

      <p>
        According to the National Institute of Mental Health, roughly one out of
        every 25 girls and women will have anorexia in their lifetime. Most will
        deny that they have an eating disorder.
      </p>

      <h4>Symptoms of anorexia include:</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Anxiety, depression, perfectionism, or being highly self-critical
        </li>
        <li>Dieting even when thin or emaciated</li>
        <li>Excessive or compulsive exercising</li>
        <li>Intense fear of becoming fat, even when underweight</li>
        <li>Menstruation that becomes infrequent or stops</li>
        <li>
          Rapid weight loss, which the person may try to conceal with loose
          clothing
        </li>
        <li>
          Strange eating habits, such as avoiding meals, eating in secret,
          monitoring every bite, or eating only certain foods in small amounts
        </li>
        <li>Unusual interest in food</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Anorexia can lead to several serious health problems, including:</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Damage to major organs, especially the brain, heart, and kidneys
        </li>
        <li>Irregular heartbeat</li>
        <li>
          Lowered blood pressure, pulse, body temperature, and breathing rates
        </li>
        <li>Sensitivity to cold</li>
        <li>Thinning of bones</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Anorexia is fatal in about one out of every 10 cases. The most common
        causes of death include cardiac arrest, electrolyte imbalance, and
        suicide.
      </p>

      <h3>Treating Anorexia</h3>

      <p>
        The first aim of treatment is to bring the young person back to normal
        weight and eating habits. Hospitalization, sometimes for weeks, may be
        necessary. In cases of extreme or life-threatening malnutrition, tube or
        intravenous feeding may be required.
      </p>

      <p>
        Long-term treatment addresses psychological issues. Treatments include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Antidepressant medication</li>
        <li>Behavioral therapy</li>
        <li>Psychotherapy</li>
        <li>Support groups</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Bulimia in Children and Teens</h3>

      <p>
        Like children and teens with anorexia, bulimic young people also fear
        weight gain and feel extremely unhappy with their bodies. They will
        repeatedly eat too much food in a short amount of time. Often the child
        or teen senses a loss of control. Feeling disgusted and ashamed after
        overeating, they try to prevent weight gain by inducing vomiting or
        using laxatives, diet pills, diuretics, or enemas. After purging the
        food, they feel relieved.
      </p>

      <p>
        Doctors diagnose bulimia when a person has two or more episodes per week
        for at least three months.
      </p>

      <p>
        People with bulimia usually fluctuate within a normal weight range,
        although they may be overweight too.
      </p>

      <h4>Symptoms of bulimia include:</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Abusing drugs and alcohol</li>
        <li>Abusing laxatives and other treatments to prevent weight gain</li>
        <li>Anxiety</li>
        <li>Bingeing on large amounts of food</li>
        <li>Eating in secret or having unusual eating habits</li>
        <li>Excessive exercise</li>
        <li>Mood swings</li>
        <li>Overemphasis on physical appearance</li>
        <li>Spending time in the bathroom after eating</li>
        <li>Sadness</li>
        <li>Scarring on knuckles from using fingers to induce vomiting</li>
        <li>Vomiting after eating</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Complications of bulimia include:</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Damage to tooth enamel from stomach acids</li>
        <li>Inflammation of the esophagus</li>
        <li>Swelling of the salivary glands in the cheeks</li>
        <li>
          Lowering of blood potassium levels, which can lead to dangerous,
          abnormal heart rhythms
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Treating Bulimia</h3>

      <p>
        Treatment aims to break the binge-and-purge cycle. Treatments may
        include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Antidepressant medication</li>
        <li>Behavior modification</li>
        <li>Individual, family, or group therapy</li>
        <li>Nutritional counseling</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Binge Eating in Children and Teens</h3>

      <p>
        Binge eating is similar to bulimia. It includes chronic, out-of-control
        eating of large amounts of food in a short time, even to the point of
        discomfort. However, binge eaters do not purge the food through vomiting
        or other means, resulting in overweight or obesity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Binge eaters may struggle to handle their emotions, and emotions such as
        anger, worry, stress, sadness, or boredom may trigger a binge. Often,
        binge eaters feel upset about overeating and may become depressed.
      </p>

      <p>
        The excess weight caused by binge eating puts children and teens at risk
        of the following health problems:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Heart disease</li>
        <li>High blood pressure</li>
        <li>High cholesterol</li>
        <li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Treating Binge Eating</h3>

      <p>Treatments for binge eating include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Behavioral therapy</li>
        <li>Medications, including antidepressants</li>
        <li>Psychotherapy</li>
      </ul>
