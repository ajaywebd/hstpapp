      <h1>ADHD</h1>
      <p>
        Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a behavior disorder.
        It is also called attention deficit disorder. It is often first
        diagnosed in childhood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Children with ADHD show signs of inattention, hyperactivity, and/or
        impulsivity in specific ways. These children:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Are in constant motion</li>
        <li>Squirm and fidget</li>
        <li>Do not seem to listen</li>
        <li>Have trouble playing quietly</li>
        <li>Often talk excessively</li>
        <li>Interrupt or intrude on others</li>
        <li>Are easily distracted</li>
        <li>Do not finish tasks</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3 Types of ADHD in Children</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>ADHD, combined type.</b> This is the most common type. A child is
          impulsive and hyperactive. He or she also has trouble paying attention
          and is easily distracted.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ADHD, impulsive/hyperactive type.</b> This is the least common type
          of ADHD. A child is impulsive and hyperactive but does not have
          trouble paying attention.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ADHD, inattentive and distractible type.</b> A child with this type
          is mostly inattentive and easily distracted.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>
      <p>
        Each child with ADHD may have different symptoms. He or she may have
        trouble paying attention, be impulsive and hyperactive. These symptoms
        most often happen together, but one may happen without the others.
      </p>
      <p>Below are the most common symptoms of ADHD:</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Inattention</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Has a short attention span for age</li>
        <li>Has a hard time listening to others</li>
        <li>Has a hard time attending to details</li>
        <li>Is easily distracted</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Has poor study skills for age</li>
      </ul>

      <hr />

      <h2>Impulsivity</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Often interrupts others</li>
        <li>
          Has a hard time waiting for his or her turn in school or social games
        </li>

        <li>Takes risks often, without thinking before acting</li>
      </ul>

      <hr />

      <h2>Hyperactivity</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Seems to always be in motion; runs or climbs, sometimes with no clear
          goal except motion

        <li>

          without completing any
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These symptoms may resemble other health or behavior problems. Many of
        these symptoms may occur in children and teens who do not have ADHD.
        However, the symptoms must greatly affect how the child functions at
        home and in school. Make sure your child sees a healthcare provider for
        an accurate diagnosis.
      </p>

      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
      <p>
        ADHD is a complex condition and can be difficult to diagnose. There is
        no single test for ADHD. Doctors diagnose ADHD in children and teens
        after discussing symptoms at length with the child, parents, and
        teachers and observing the child's behaviors. The doctor will also
        gather information about family history and consider all possible
        causes.
      </p>
      <p>
        To confirm a diagnosis of ADHD or learning differences, tests may be
        given to assess a child's neurological and psychological status. These
        evaluations are often done with input from parents and teachers, and
        administered by experienced pediatricians or mental health
        professionals.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
      <p>
        The most effective treatment for ADHD is often a combination of
        medication, psychological, and behavioral therapies. Close cooperation
        between therapists, doctors, teachers, and parents is essential for
        success.
      </p>

      <h2>Stimulants</h2>
      <p>
        Stimulants are the most commonly prescribed medications for treating
        ADHD. These drugs often decrease hyperactivity and improve
        concentration. Common medications include Adderall, Focalin, Vyvanse,
        and Ritalin, among others.
