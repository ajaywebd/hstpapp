      <h1>Appendicitis</h1>
      <p>
        Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix. It may be acute or
        chronic.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the United States, appendicitis is the most common cause of abdominal
        pain resulting in surgery. About 5 percent of Americans will experience
        appendicitis at some point in their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Appendicitis can happen at any time, but it occurs most often between
        the ages of 10 and 30. It's more common in males than in females.
      </p>
      <p>
        If left untreated, appendicitis may cause your appendix to burst and
        cause infection. This can be serious and sometimes fatal.
      </p>
      <p>Read on to learn more about symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment.</p>

      <h2>Is it appendicitis or gas?</h2>
      <p>
        Indigestion or other gas-related pain are common symptoms of
        appendicitis. In some cases, you may feel as though the gas is trapped
        and find that you're unable to expel the gas.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're only experiencing mild gas-related discomfort, you can take an
        over-the-counter (OTC) heartburn medication and see if your symptoms
        fade.
      </p>
      <p>Popular OTC options include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>omeprazole (Prilosec)</li>
        <li>lansoprazole (Prevacid)</li>
        <li>ranitidine (Zantac)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If your symptoms persist for more than a day or cause you unbearable
        pain or discomfort, see your doctor right away. You should also see your
        doctor if you're experiencing any other unusual symptoms.
      </p>

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>
      <p>
        If you have appendicitis, you may experience one or more of the
        following symptoms:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>pain around the bellybutton</li>
        <li>lower right side abdominal pain</li>
        <li>loss of appetite</li>
        <li>nausea</li>
        <li>vomiting</li>
        <li>diarrhea</li>
        <li>constipation</li>
        <li>inability to pass gas</li>
        <li>abdominal swelling</li>
        <li>low-grade fever</li>
        <li>a sense that you might feel better after passing stool</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Appendicitis pain may start off as mild cramping. It often becomes more
        steady and severe over time. You may also feel a general pain become
        more targeted.
      </p>
      <p>
        You likely won’t notice changes in your bowel habits. However,
        appendicitis can sometimes affect urination.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you suspect you may have appendicitis, you should avoid taking
        laxatives or having an enema. These treatments may cause your appendix
        to burst if you're experiencing appendicitis.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have tenderness on your right side along with any of these other
        symptoms, see your doctor. Appendicitis can quickly become a medical
        emergency.
      </p>

      <h2>Are the symptoms of appendicitis the same in teens?</h2>
      <p>
        Although the symptoms of appendicitis are the same for adolescents as
        they are for adults, they may begin differently. In adolescents,
        appendicitis can begin as a vague stomachache near the navel. This pain
        may progress to the lower right side of the abdomen.
      </p>
      <p>After this pain has appeared, you may:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>develop a fever</li>
        <li>lose their appetite</li>
        <li>feel nauseous</li>
        <li>vomit</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you're experiencing these symptoms, see your doctor.</p>

      <h2>Causes</h2>
      <p>
        In many cases, the cause for appendicitis is unknown. There can also be
        multiple causes for one case of appendicitis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Doctors believe an obstruction in the appendix may cause appendicitis.
        Obstruction may be either partial or complete. Complete obstruction is a
        cause for emergency surgery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obstruction is often due to an accumulation of fecal matter. It can also
        be the result of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>enlarged lymphoid follicles</li>
        <li>worms</li>
        <li>trauma</li>
        <li>tumors</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When there’s an obstruction in your appendix, bacteria can multiply
        inside the organ. This leads to the formation of pus. The increased
        pressure can be painful. It can also compress local blood vessels. A
        lack of blood flow to the appendix may cause gangrene.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the appendix ruptures, fecal matter can fill the abdomen. This is a
        medical emergency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Peritonitis is another possible consequence of a ruptured appendix. It’s
        an inflammation of the tissue that lines the abdominal wall. Other
        organs can also become inflamed after a rupture. Affected organs may
        include the cecum, bladder, and sigmoid colon.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the infected appendix leaks instead of ruptures, it can form an
        abscess. This confines the infection to a small walled off area.
        However, an abscess can still be dangerous.
      </p>

      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
      <p>
        Your doctor will begin by performing a physical exam. They will look for
        tenderness in the lower right quadrant of your abdomen. If you’re
        pregnant, the pain may be higher. If perforation occurs, your stomach
        may become hard and swollen.
      </p>
      <p>
        There isn’t any one test to diagnose appendicitis. First, your doctor
        will order a complete blood count (CBC) test. A CBC can determine if
        there’s a bacterial infection. Bacterial infection is often correlated
        with appendicitis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your doctor will also perform several tests to rule out other similar
        conditions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Urinalysis</b> can rule out a urinary tract infection or kidney
          stone.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Pelvic exams</b> can make certain that you aren’t experiencing any
          reproductive problems. They can also rule out other pelvic infections.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Pregnancy tests</b> can rule out a suspected ectopic pregnancy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Abdominal imaging</b> can determine if you have an abscess or other
          complications. This may be done with an X-ray, ultrasound, or CT scan.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Chest X-ray</b> can rule out right lower lobe pneumonia. This
          sometimes has symptoms similar to appendicitis.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
      <p>
        If your doctor is unable to pinpoint another cause for your symptoms,
        you will be diagnosed with appendicitis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Treatment for appendicitis varies. In most cases, however, surgery will
        be necessary. The type of surgery will depend on the details of your
        case.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have an abscess that hasn’t ruptured, your doctor may first
        administer antibiotics. Your doctor will then drain the abscess using a
        tube placed through your skin. After you’ve received treatment for the
        infection, you’ll undergo surgery to remove your appendix.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have a ruptured abscess or appendix, surgery may be necessary
        right away. Surgery to remove the appendix is known as an appendectomy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your doctor can perform this procedure as open surgery or through a
        laparoscopy. Laparoscopy is less invasive, making the recovery time
        shorter. However, open surgery may be necessary if you have an abscess
        or peritonitis.
      </p>
      <p>
        In rare cases, appendicitis may get better without surgery. This is only
        an option if your abdominal pain is minimal and your diagnostic tests
        are normal. In this scenario, your treatment plan might only involve
        antibiotics and a liquid diet until your symptoms resolve.
      </p>

      <h2>Recovery time</h2>
      <p>
        If you undergo a laparoscopy, you will likely leave the hospital a few
        days after the operation. This surgery is less invasive, so the recovery
        time tends to be shorter.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you undergo open surgery or experience additional complications, such
        as peritonitis, you may have to remain at the hospital for up to a week,
        and a drain may be needed. If your abdominal muscles need to be cut
        during the procedure, your recovery time may be longer.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may experience tenderness and bruising after your operation. This
        will improve over time and may be relieved by over-the-counter pain
        killers, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil).
      </p>
      <p>
        You may also experience temporary constipation. Staying hydrated and
        eating fiber-rich foods may help regulate your bowel movements.
      </p>

      <h2>Foods high in fiber include:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>split peas</li>
        <li>lentils</li>
        <li>black beans</li>
        <li>lima beans</li>
        <li>artichokes</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You should be able to resume normal activities within a couple of weeks.
        Your doctor may advise you to avoid strenuous activity, such as sports
        and heavy lifting, for four to six weeks after your surgery.
      </p>

      <h2>Appendicitis in pregnancy</h2>
      <p>
        During pregnancy, acute appendicitis is the most common non-obstetric
        emergency requiring surgery. It occurs at the same rate in women who are
        and aren’t pregnant.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it does occur in pregnant women, it’s usually during the second or
        third trimester. Its symptoms can often be mistaken for routine
        discomfort associated with pregnancy, making diagnosis difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
        Delayed diagnosis can increase your risk of complications, including
        fetal loss. Women who are pregnant also have a higher risk of
        perforation or rupture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Treatment for women who are pregnant and have appendicitis is the same
        as for women who aren’t pregnant.
      </p>
      <p>
        During recovery, women who are pregnant will be monitored even more
        closely by their surgeon, primary doctor, and obstetrician.
      </p>
      <p>
        If laparoscopic surgery is done, the recovery process generally is
        similar for women who are and aren’t pregnant.
      </p>
      <p>
        If an open surgical procedure is needed, your recovery time may be
        longer. This is especially true if your abdominal muscles are cut during
        the procedure or if there’s peritonitis. In some cases, peritonitis may
        cause a fetal loss.
