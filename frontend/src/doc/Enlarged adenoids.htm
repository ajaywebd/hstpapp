      <h1>Enlarged Adenoids</h1>

      <p>
        Adenoids are small patches of tissue located at the back of the throat.
        They are similar to the tonsils and are located right above them. Your
        tonsils can be seen if you look at the back of your throat, but the
        adenoids aren’t directly visible. Both adenoids and tonsils are part of
        the immune system, which helps to prevent and fight infection in your
        body.
      </p>

      <p>
        The adenoids can cause problems if they become enlarged. Fortunately,
        they’re not an essential part of the immune system, and they can
        generally be treated by removing them.
      </p>

      <h2>Causes</h2>

      <p>
        Adenoids are present at birth. They grow until a child is between the
        ages of 3 and 5. Normally, they begin to shrink after around age 7. They
        shrink considerably in adulthood.
      </p>

      <p>
        They're located in the passage that connects the back of the nasal
        cavity to the throat. They produce antibodies to help your body fight
        off infections. During the early years, adenoids help protect infants
        from infection by trapping bacteria and viruses that enter the body
        through the nose.
      </p>

      <p>
        Adenoids that become infected usually enlarge, but return to their
        normal size when the infection subsides. However, in some instances, the
        adenoids remain enlarged even after the infection is gone. Enlarged
        adenoids can also be caused by allergies, and some children have
        enlarged adenoids from birth.
      </p>

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>

      <p>Enlarged adenoids can cause a number of symptoms, including:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Blocked, stuffy nose</li>
        <li>Ear problems</li>
        <li>Problems sleeping</li>
        <li>Snoring</li>
        <li>Sore throat</li>
        <li>Difficulty swallowing</li>
        <li>Swollen glands in the neck</li>
        <li>Problems breathing through the nose</li>
        <li>
          "Glue ear," or otitis media with effusion (fluid buildup in the middle
          ear, which can cause hearing problems)
        </li>
        <li>Cracked lips and dry mouth (from breathing problems)</li>
        <li>Sleep apnea (pauses in breathing during sleep)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>

      <p>
        The doctor will first ask about the symptoms your child is experiencing,
        followed by a physical exam. The doctor will use a special mirror and
        insert a small, flexible telescope (endoscope) through the nose to view
        the adenoids.
      </p>

      <p>
        Depending on what the doctor finds, your child may need a blood test to
        check for infection. In some cases, an X-ray of the throat may be
        necessary.
      </p>

      <p>
        In severe cases, your child may need to undergo a sleep study to
        determine if they’re suffering from sleep apnea. During the study, your
        child will sleep overnight at a facility while their breathing and brain
        activity are monitored.
      </p>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>

      <p>
        Treatment depends on the severity of the condition. If your child’s
        enlarged adenoids aren’t infected, the doctor may not recommend surgery.
        Instead, the doctor may opt to wait and see if the adenoids shrink on
        their own as your child gets older.
      </p>

      <p>
        In other cases, the doctor may recommend medication, such as a nasal
        steroid, to shrink enlarged adenoids. However, if the adenoids continue
        to cause problems despite treatment with medications, they may need to
        be removed. This surgery is called an adenoidectomy.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a child has frequent tonsil infections, the doctor might remove the
        tonsils as well. The tonsils and adenoids are often removed at the same
        time.
      </p>

      <h2>Surgery and Recovery</h2>

      <p>
        Your child will be given a mild sedative before surgery and placed under
        general anesthesia. The surgery usually lasts no more than two hours.
      </p>

      <p>After the adenoids are removed, your child might experience:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A sore throat</li>
        <li>Minor bleeding</li>
        <li>Earaches</li>
        <li>A blocked nose</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The doctor will prescribe an antibiotic to protect against infection and
        may provide a mild pain reliever for the first few days. Cold, icy
        drinks like milkshakes and ice cream are recommended, while warm foods
        should be avoided for the first week. Symptoms should clear up in a few
        weeks.
      </p>

      <h2>Long-term Outlook</h2>

      <p>
        Enlarged adenoids are common in children. Be sure to have your child
        examined as soon as possible if they are experiencing any symptoms of
        enlarged adenoids. Enlarged adenoids are a treatable condition, and some
        cases can be resolved with simple antibiotics.
