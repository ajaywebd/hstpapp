      <h1>Eczema</h1>

      <p>
        Eczema (<em>eg-zuh-MUH</em>) is the name for a group of conditions that
        cause the skin to become red, itchy, and inflamed.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are several types of eczema. Atopic dermatitis, contact
        dermatitis, dyshidrotic eczema, and seborrheic dermatitis (also known as
        "cradle cap" in infants) are the most common types that affect children.
        Eczema, especially atopic dermatitis, often appears in the first six
        months to five years of a child's life.
      </p>

      <p>Eczema is not contagious. You can't "catch it" from someone else.</p>

      <p>
        For most types of eczema, managing flares comes down to these basics:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Know your child's particular triggers</b> to avoid exposure.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Implement a daily bathing and moisturizing routine</b> to protect
          the skin and lock in moisture.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Use OTC and prescription medication</b> consistently and as
          prescribed to curb symptoms.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        There is no cure for eczema, but treatments include over-the-counter
        (OTC) remedies, prescription topical medications, phototherapy, and
        immunosuppressants.
      </p>

      <p>
        Eczema, especially atopic dermatitis (AD), may look and act very
        differently as your child grows. Understanding the type of eczema they
        have, along with their symptoms and triggers, can help manage and treat
        it more effectively.
      </p>

      <h2>Causes</h2>

      <p>Some of the most common eczema triggers include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Dry skin</li>
        <li>Irritants</li>
        <li>Heat and sweating</li>
        <li>Infection</li>
        <li>Allergens such as pet dander, pollen, or dust</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Your child's eczema may worsen in winter when the air is dry. Saliva
        from drooling can also cause irritation on your baby’s cheeks, chin, and
        neck.
      </p>

      <p>
        The best way to manage your child's eczema is by understanding their
        symptoms and triggers to help keep it under control.
      </p>

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>

      <p>
        Eczema locations may change with age. In infants and young children, it
        is usually found on the face, outside the elbows, and on the knees. In
        older children and adults, it often appears on the hands, feet, arms,
        and behind the knees. Symptoms may include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Dry, scaly skin</li>
        <li>Small bumps that open and weep when scratched</li>
        <li>Redness and swelling of the skin</li>
        <li>Thickening of the skin (in chronic cases)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Excessive rubbing and scratching can tear the skin, potentially causing
        infection. Some children may have only occasional flare-ups, while
        others may experience eczema into adulthood.
      </p>

      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>

      <p>
        Eczema is common. According to the National Institute of Arthritis and
        Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, at least 10 percent of infants and
        children have atopic dermatitis. Diagnosis is typically based on a
        physical examination and medical history and may also include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Family history (children born to a mother with allergies are more
          prone to eczema)
        </li>
        <li>Personal history of allergies or asthma</li>
        <li>Blood tests</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>

      <p>
        <b
          >Treatment for eczema will be determined by the child's physician
          based on:</b
        >
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The child's age, overall health, and medical history</li>
        <li>The extent of the disorder</li>
        <li>
          The child's tolerance for specific medications, procedures, or
          therapies
        </li>
        <li>Expectations for the course of the reaction</li>
        <li>The child or parent's preference</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <b>Note:</b> There is no cure for eczema. The goals of treatment are to
        reduce itching and inflammation, moisturize the skin, and prevent
        infection.
      </p>

      <h2>Developing Treatments</h2>

      <p>
        A new class of medications, called topical immunomodulators (TIMs),
        offers a steroid-free treatment option for atopic dermatitis. TIMs can
        be used anywhere on the body to relieve itching, redness, and pain
        caused by eczema. The first TIM approved by the FDA is Tacrolimus.
        Another promising TIM is Pimecrolimus.
      </p>

      <p>
        The FDA advises against using TIMs in children under two years of age.
        Always consult the child's physician for more information.
      </p>

      <h2>How can eczema be managed?</h2>

      <p>The following are suggestions for managing eczema:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Avoid contact with irritants, as determined by the child's physician.
        </li>
        <li>Bathe regularly, use moisturizers, and practice good skincare.</li>
        <li>
          Keep the child's room cool at night to prevent sweating, which can
          irritate the skin.
        </li>
        <li>Avoid harsh soaps. Ask the physician to recommend a brand.</li>
        <li>
          Keep the child's fingernails short to reduce infection risk from
          scratching.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use lubricating lotions daily. Ask the physician to recommend a brand.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Treatment for Severe Eczema</h2>

      <p>
        <b
          >In severe cases, the physician may prescribe medications,
          including:</b
        >
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Antihistamines:</b> These medications help decrease itching.
          Examples include diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) and hydroxyzine
          (Atarax®). New antihistamines that do not cause drowsiness are also
          available.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Steroid creams:</b> These topical medications reduce inflammation,
          swelling, and itching. Steroid overuse can damage the skin, so follow
          the physician's advice.
        </li>
        <li><b>Oral antibiotics:</b> To treat infection if necessary.</li>
      </ul>
