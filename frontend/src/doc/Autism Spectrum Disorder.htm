      <h1>Autism Spectrum Disorder</h1>

      <p>
        Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a problem that affects a child’s
        nervous system and growth and development. It usually shows up during a
        child’s first 3 years of life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some children with ASD seem to live in their own world. They are not
        interested in other children and lack social awareness. A child with ASD
        focuses on following a routine that may include usual behaviors. A child
        with the disorder also often has problems communicating with others and
        may not start speaking as soon as other children. He or she may not want
        to make eye contact with other people.
      </p>

      <p>
        ASD can keep a child from developing social skills. This is in part
        because a child with ASD may not be able to understand facial
        expressions or emotions in other people. A child with ASD may:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Not want to be touched</li>
        <li>Want to play alone</li>
        <li>Not want to change routines</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        A child with ASD may also repeat movements, such as flapping their hands
        or rocking. They may also have unusual attachments to objects. However,
        some children with ASD may do certain mental tasks very well, such as
        counting, or they may excel in areas like art or music and have a great
        memory for certain details.
      </p>

      <h2>Causes of ASD in a child</h2>

      <p>
        Researchers don’t know what causes ASD. It may be linked to certain
        genes. A child with ASD may also have structural problems in the brain
        or chemical imbalances. However, it is clear that ASD is not caused by
        the way parents raise their children.
      </p>

      <p>
        In less common cases, other factors that may contribute to ASD include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Exposure to toxins in the environment before or after birth</li>
        <li>Problems during delivery</li>
        <li>Infections before birth</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Which children are at risk for ASD?</h2>

      <p>
        The disorder occurs much more often in boys than girls, with four to
        five times as many boys affected.
      </p>

      <p>
        Certain gene disorders that run in families can increase a child's risk
        for ASD, including:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Fragile-X syndrome</li>
        <li>Phenylketonuria (PKU)</li>
        <li>Neurofibromatosis</li>
        <li>Tuberous sclerosis</li>
        <li>Chromosome problems</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Your child may need genetic testing to determine if they have any of
        these problems. Testing is done by a medical geneticist, a healthcare
        provider with specialized training in genetic conditions. They can help
        you understand the chances of having another child with the same genetic
        condition. For instance, PKU carries a 1 in 4 chance of recurrence in
        future pregnancies, while tuberous sclerosis has a 1 in 2 chance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even when no specific gene problem is identified, having one child with
        ASD slightly increases the chances of having another child with ASD.
        Researchers believe this is because multiple genes from both parents may
        interact to cause ASD.
      </p>

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>

      <p>
        Each child may experience slightly different symptoms of ASD. However,
        common symptoms include:
      </p>

      <h3>Social Symptoms</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Problems making eye contact with others</li>
        <li>Difficulty making friends or interacting with other children</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Communication Symptoms</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Poor communication skills</li>
        <li>Delayed speech development or no speech at all</li>
        <li>Failure to use speech in social interactions</li>
        <li>Repetitive language (echolalia) or repeating TV/movie phrases</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Behavior Symptoms</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Repetitive movements such as rocking or flapping hands</li>
        <li>
          Heightened or diminished sensitivity to lights, sounds, touch, or
          taste
        </li>
        <li>Rigid rituals</li>
        <li>Strong need for routines</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The symptoms of ASD may resemble other health conditions, so it's
        essential to consult with a healthcare provider for a diagnosis.
      </p>

      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>

      <p>
        No single medical test can diagnose ASD. Healthcare providers use
        certain guidelines to diagnose ASD in children before age 2. Early
        diagnosis allows treatment to begin as soon as possible, which can
        improve the child's development.
      </p>

      <p>
        The guidelines recommend that all children be screened for ASD and other
        developmental disorders before age 2 during routine well-child checkups.
        Children with developmental or behavioral concerns will need additional
        testing for ASD.
      </p>

      <h3>Warning Signs</h3>

      <p>
        During well-child visits before age 2, healthcare providers look for
        signs such as:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>No babbling, pointing, or gesturing by age 12 months</li>
        <li>No single words spoken by age 16 months</li>
        <li>No two-word phrases by age 24 months, only repeating sounds</li>
        <li>Loss of language or social skills at any age</li>
        <li>No eye contact by 3 to 4 months</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If any of these issues are present, the healthcare provider will conduct
        further screenings to determine if the child has ASD or another
        developmental disorder.
      </p>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>

      <p>
        Every child with ASD requires a personalized treatment plan, which
        should begin as early as possible and involve the child's parents.
        Treatment may include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Behavioral therapy:</strong> Programs that teach social,
          movement, and cognitive skills, and help change problematic behaviors.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Special education:</strong> Programs focusing on social
          skills, language, self-care, and vocational skills.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Medication:</strong> Some children may benefit from
          medications that help manage certain symptoms.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In addition, your family may need mental health support, such as parent
        counseling, social skills training, and one-on-one therapy. A healthcare
        provider can help you find the right treatment options for your child.
      </p>

      <h2>Prevention</h2>

      <p>
        There is no known way to prevent ASD. However, early diagnosis and
        intervention can help reduce symptoms and support a child’s development,
        ultimately improving their quality of life.
      </p>

      <h2>Living with Autism</h2>

      <p>
        Your child's primary care provider plays a key role in supporting both
        you and your child. They will help you understand treatment options and
        how to care for your child. Parents play a crucial role in the treatment
        and well-being of a child with ASD. Here are some things you can do:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Keep all appointments with your child’s healthcare provider.</li>
        <li>
          Work with your child’s healthcare provider and schools to develop a
          treatment plan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reach out for support from local community services, which can provide
          assistance and connections with other parents of children with ASD.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Points</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects a child's nervous system and
          development.
        </li>
        <li>
          A child with ASD may have difficulty communicating and developing
          social skills.
        </li>
        <li>Genetics may play a role in ASD.</li>
        <li>All children should be screened for ASD by age 2.</li>
        <li>Diagnosis may involve imaging and genetic testing.</li>
        <li>
          Children with ASD need individualized treatment plans that may include
          behavioral programs, special education, and medication.
        </li>
