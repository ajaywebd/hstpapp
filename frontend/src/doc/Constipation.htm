      <h1>Constipation</h1>

      <p>
        Constipation in children is a common problem. A constipated child has
        infrequent bowel movements or hard, dry stools.
      </p>

      <p>
        Common causes include early toilet training and changes in diet.
        Fortunately, most cases of constipation in children are temporary.
      </p>

      <p>
        Encouraging your child to make simple dietary changes such as eating
        more fiber-rich fruits and vegetables and drinking more fluids can go a
        long way toward alleviating constipation. If your child's doctor
        approves, it may be possible to treat a child's constipation with
        laxatives.
      </p>

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>

      <p>Signs and symptoms of constipation in children may include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Less than three bowel movements a week</li>
        <li>Bowel movements that are hard, dry, and difficult to pass</li>
        <li>Large-diameter stools that may obstruct the toilet</li>
        <li>Pain while having a bowel movement</li>
        <li>Abdominal pain</li>
        <li>
          Traces of liquid or clay-like stool in your child's underwear, a sign
          that stool is backed up in the rectum
        </li>
        <li>Blood on the surface of hard stool</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If your child fears that having a bowel movement will hurt, he or she
        may try to avoid it. You may notice your child crossing his or her legs,
        clenching their buttocks, twisting their body, or making faces when
        attempting to hold stool.
      </p>

      <h2>When to see a doctor</h2>

      <p>
        Constipation in children usually isn’t serious. However, chronic
        constipation may lead to complications or signal an underlying
        condition. Take your child to a doctor if the constipation lasts longer
        than two weeks or is accompanied by:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Vomiting</li>
        <li>Blood in the stool</li>
        <li>Abdominal swelling</li>
        <li>Weight loss</li>
        <li>Painful tears in the skin around the anus (anal fissures)</li>
        <li>Intestinal protrusion out of the anus (rectal prolapse)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Causes</h2>

      <p>
        Constipation most commonly occurs when waste or stool moves too slowly
        through the digestive tract, causing the stool to become hard and dry.
      </p>

      <p>Many factors can contribute to constipation in children, including:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Withholding:</b> Your child may ignore the urge to have a bowel
          movement because he or she is afraid of the toilet or doesn't want to
          take a break from play. Some children withhold when they're away from
          home because they're uncomfortable using public toilets. Painful bowel
          movements caused by large, hard stools may also lead to withholding.
          If it hurts to poop, your child may try to avoid a repeat of the
          distressing experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Toilet training issues:</b> If you begin toilet training too soon,
          your child may rebel and hold in stool. If toilet training becomes a
          battle of wills, a voluntary decision to ignore the urge to poop can
          quickly become an involuntary habit that's tough to change.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Changes in diet:</b> Not enough fiber-rich fruits and vegetables or
          fluid in your child's diet may cause constipation. One of the more
          common times for children to become constipated is when they're
          switching from an all-liquid diet to one that includes solid foods.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Changes in routine:</b> Any changes in your child's routine, such
          as travel, hot weather, or stress, can affect bowel function. Children
          are also more likely to experience constipation when they first start
          school outside of the home.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Medications:</b> Certain antidepressants and various other drugs
          can contribute to constipation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cow's milk allergy:</b> An allergy to cow's milk or consuming too
          many dairy products sometimes leads to constipation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Family history:</b> Children who have family members who have
          experienced constipation are more likely to develop constipation. This
          may be due to shared genetic or environmental factors.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Medical conditions:</b> Rarely, constipation in children indicates
          an anatomic malformation, a metabolic or digestive system problem, or
          another underlying condition.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Risk factors</h2>

      <p>Constipation in children is more likely for kids who:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Are sedentary</li>
        <li>Don't eat enough fiber</li>
        <li>Don't drink enough fluids</li>
        <li>Take certain medications, including some antidepressants</li>
        <li>Have a medical condition affecting the anus or rectum</li>
        <li>Have a family history of constipation</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>

      <p>Your child’s doctor will:</p>

      <p>
        <b>Gather a complete medical history.</b> Your child’s doctor will ask
        you about your child’s past illnesses and will likely inquire about your
        child’s diet and physical activity patterns.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Conduct a physical exam.</b> Your child’s physical exam will likely
        include placing a gloved finger into your child’s anus to check for
        abnormalities or the presence of impacted stool. Stool found in the
        rectum may be tested for blood.
      </p>

      <p>
        More-extensive testing is usually reserved for only the most severe
        cases of constipation. If necessary, these tests may include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Abdominal X-ray:</b> This standard X-ray test allows your child's
          doctor to see if there are any blockages in your child's abdomen.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Anorectal manometry or motility test:</b> In this test, a thin tube
          called a catheter is placed in the rectum to measure the coordination
          of the muscles your child uses to pass stool.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Barium enema X-ray:</b> In this test, the lining of the bowel is
          coated with a contrast dye (barium) so that the rectum, colon, and
          sometimes part of the small intestine can be clearly seen on an X-ray.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Rectal biopsy:</b> In this test, a small sample of tissue is taken
          from the lining of the rectum to see if nerve cells are normal.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Transit study or marker study:</b> In this test, your child will
          swallow a capsule containing markers that show up on X-rays taken over
          several days. Your child's doctor will analyze the way the markers
          move through your child's digestive tract.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Blood tests:</b> Occasionally, blood tests are performed, such as a
          thyroid panel.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>

      <p>Depending on the circumstances, your child's doctor may recommend:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Over-the-counter fiber supplements or stool softeners:</b> If your
          child doesn't get a lot of fiber in their diet, adding an
          over-the-counter fiber supplement such as Metamucil or Citrucel, might
          help. However, your child needs to drink at least 32 ounces (about 1
          liter) of water daily for these products to work well. Check with your
          child's doctor to find out the right dose for your child's age and
          weight.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Glycerin suppositories:</b> These can be used to soften the stool
          in children who can't swallow pills. Talk with your child's doctor
          about the right way to use these products.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>A laxative or enema:</b> If an accumulation of fecal material
          creates a blockage, your child's doctor may suggest a laxative or
          enema to help remove the blockage. Examples include polyethylene
          glycol (Glycolax, MiraLax) and mineral oil.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Hospital enema:</b> Sometimes a child may be so severely
          constipated that he or she needs to be hospitalized for a short time
          to be given a stronger enema that will clear the bowels. This is
          called disimpaction.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Complications</h2>

      <p>
        Although constipation in children can be uncomfortable, it usually isn't
        serious. If constipation becomes chronic, however, complications may
        include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Painful breaks in the skin around the anus (anal fissures)</li>
        <li>Rectal prolapse, when the rectum comes out of the anus</li>
        <li>Stool withholding</li>
        <li>
          Avoiding bowel movements because of pain, which causes impacted stool
          to collect in the colon and rectum and leak out (encopresis)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Prevention</h2>

      <p>To help prevent constipation in children:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Offer your child high-fiber foods:</b> Serve your child more
          high-fiber foods, such as fruits, vegetables, beans, and whole-grain
          cereals and breads. If your child isn't used to a high-fiber diet,
          start by adding just several grams of fiber a day to prevent gas and
          bloating.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Encourage your child to drink plenty of fluids:</b> Water is often
          the best.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Promote physical activity:</b> Regular physical activity helps
          stimulate normal bowel function.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Create a toilet routine:</b> Regularly set aside time after meals
          for your child to use the toilet. If necessary, provide a footstool so
          that your child is comfortable sitting on the toilet and has enough
          leverage to release a stool.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Remind your child to heed nature's call:</b> Some children get so
          wrapped up in play that they ignore the urge to have a bowel movement.
          If such delays occur often, they can contribute to constipation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Lifestyle and home remedies</h2>

      <p>
        Often, simple changes in diet and routine help relieve constipation in
        children:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>A high-fiber diet:</b> A diet rich in fiber can help your child's
          body form soft, bulky stool. The recommended intake for dietary fiber
          is 14 grams for every 1,000 calories in your child's diet.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Adequate fluids:</b> Water and other fluids will help soften your
          child's stool. Be wary of offering your child too much milk, however.
          For some children, excess milk contributes to constipation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Adequate time for bowel movements:</b> Encourage your child to sit
          on the toilet for five to 10 minutes within 30 minutes after each
          meal. Follow the routine every day, even during holidays and
          vacations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Be supportive:</b> Reward your child's efforts, not results. Give
          children small rewards for trying to move their bowels. Possible
          rewards include stickers or a special book or game that's only
          available after toilet time. Don’t punish a child who has soiled their
          underwear.
        </li>
      </ul>
