          Addison's disease is when the adrenal glands don't make enough of two
          steroid hormones. The hormones are cortisol and aldosterone. Cortisol
          controls the body's metabolism, blocks inflammatory reactions, and
          affects the immune system. Aldosterone manages sodium and potassium
          levels. The adrenal glands sit on top of the kidneys. There is one
          gland on top of each kidney. Addison's disease is fairly rare and may
          first appear at any age.

      <h2 class="sub-title">What causes Addison's disease in a child?</h2>
      <p class="main-text">
        The most common cause of Addison's disease is damage to the adrenal
        glands caused by an autoimmune disease. Other cases of Addison's disease
        are caused by damage to the glands by any of these:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Cancer</li>
        <li>Infection</li>
        <li>An autoimmune problem</li>
        <li>A rare genetic disease</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="main-text">
        In rare cases, Addison's disease is passed down in a family.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-title">Who's at risk?</h2>
      <p class="main-text">
        A child is at risk for Addison's disease if they have any of the
        following:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>An autoimmune disease</li>
        <li>Cancer</li>
        <li>Infection such as tuberculosis</li>
        <li>Family history of the disease</li>
        <li>History of using corticosteroid medicine</li>
        <li>History of using antifungal medicine</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="sub-title">Symptoms of Addison's disease in a child</h2>
      <p class="main-text">
        Mild symptoms may only occur when a child is under physical stress.
        Symptoms may include:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Muscle weakness</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Dizziness</li>
        <li>Fast pulse</li>
        <li>Dark skin, first seen on hands and face</li>
        <li>Black freckles</li>
        <li>
          Bluish-black color around the nipples, mouth, rectum, scrotum, or
          vagina
        </li>
        <li>Weight loss</li>
        <li>Dehydration</li>
        <li>Loss of appetite</li>
        <li>Intense salt craving</li>
        <li>Muscle aches</li>
        <li>Nausea</li>
        <li>Vomiting</li>
        <li>Diarrhea</li>
        <li>Intolerance to cold</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="main-text">
        These symptoms can be similar to other health conditions, so it's
        important to consult a healthcare provider for a proper diagnosis.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-title">Addison's disease diagnosis</h2>
      <p class="main-text">
        Diagnosis may include laboratory blood tests, an ACTH stimulation test
        to assess adrenal function, and measurement of electrolytes in the
        blood.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-title">Treatment for Addison's disease</h2>
      <p class="main-text">
        The goal of treatment is to replace the missing hormones and relieve the
        symptoms. Corticosteroid medicine, often taken for life, may be
        prescribed, and additional medication might be necessary to manage
        sodium and potassium levels.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-title">Possible complications</h2>
      <p class="main-text">
        If left untreated, Addison's disease can lead to severe complications
        such as:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Severe abdominal pain</li>
        <li>Extreme weakness</li>
        <li>Low blood pressure</li>
        <li>Kidney failure</li>
        <li>Shock from dehydration</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="sub-title">Key points</h2>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          Addison's disease is caused by insufficient production of cortisol and
          aldosterone by the adrenal glands.
        </li>
        <li>
          The most common cause is autoimmune damage to the adrenal glands.
        </li>
        <li>Treatment involves lifelong hormone replacement therapy.</li>
        <li>
          Untreated Addison's disease can lead to severe complications,
          especially during physical stress.
