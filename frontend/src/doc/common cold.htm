      <h1><b>Common cold</b></h1>

      <p>
        The common cold is a viral infection of your nose and throat (upper
        respiratory tract). It's usually harmless, although it might not feel
        that way. Many types of viruses can cause a common cold.
      </p>

      <p>
        Children younger than 6 are at greatest risk of colds, but healthy
        adults can also expect to have two or three colds annually.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most people recover from a common cold in a week or 10 days. Symptoms
        might last longer in people who smoke. If symptoms don't improve, see
        your doctor.
      </p>

      <p><b>Symptoms</b></p>

      <p>
        Symptoms of a common cold usually appear one to three days after
        exposure to a cold-causing virus. Signs and symptoms, which can vary
        from person to person, might include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Runny or stuffy nose</li>
        <li>Sore throat</li>
        <li>Cough</li>
        <li>Congestion</li>
        <li>Slight body aches or a mild headache</li>
        <li>Sneezing</li>
        <li>Low-grade fever</li>
        <li>Generally feeling unwell (malaise)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The discharge from your nose may become thicker and yellow or green in
        color as a common cold runs its course. This isn't an indication of a
        bacterial infection.
      </p>

      <p><b>When to see a doctor</b></p>

      <p>
        In general, your child doesn’t need to see the doctor for a common cold.
        But seek medical attention right away if your child has any of the
        following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Fever of 100.4 F (38 C) in newborns up to 12 weeks</li>
        <li>
          Rising fever or fever lasting more than two days in a child of any age
        </li>
        <li>Symptoms that worsen or fail to improve</li>
        <li>Severe symptoms, such as headache or cough</li>
        <li>Wheezing</li>
        <li>Ear pain</li>
        <li>Extreme fussiness</li>
        <li>Unusual drowsiness</li>
        <li>Lack of appetite</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Causes</b></p>

      <p>
        Although many types of viruses can cause a common cold, rhinoviruses are
        the most common culprit.
      </p>

      <p>
        A cold virus enters your body through your mouth, eyes, or nose. The
        virus can spread through droplets in the air when someone who is sick
        coughs, sneezes, or talks.
      </p>

      <p>
        It also spreads by hand-to-hand contact with someone who has a cold or
        by sharing contaminated objects, such as utensils, towels, toys, or
        telephones. If you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth after such contact or
        exposure, you're likely to catch a cold.
      </p>

      <p><b>Risk factors</b></p>

      <p>These factors can increase your chances of getting a cold:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Age:</b> Children younger than 6 are at greatest risk of colds,
          especially if they spend time in child-care settings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Weakened immune system:</b> Having a chronic illness or otherwise
          weakened immune system increases your risk.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Time of year:</b> Both children and adults are more susceptible to
          colds in fall and winter, but you can get a cold anytime.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Smoking:</b> You're more likely to catch a cold and have
          more-severe colds if you're exposed to cigarette smoke.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Exposure:</b> If you're around many people, such as at school or on
          an airplane, you're likely to be exposed to viruses that cause colds.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Complications</b></p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Acute ear infection (otitis media):</b> This occurs when bacteria
          or viruses enter the space behind the eardrum. Typical signs and
          symptoms include earaches and, in some cases, a green or yellow
          discharge from the nose or the return of a fever following a common
          cold.
        </li>
        <li><b>Asthma:</b> A cold can trigger an asthma attack.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Acute sinusitis:</b> In adults or children, a common cold that
          doesn't resolve can lead to inflammation and infection of the sinuses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Other secondary infections:</b> These include strep throat,
          pneumonia, and croup or bronchiolitis in children. These infections
          need to be treated by a doctor.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Prevention</b></p>

      <p>
        There's no vaccine for the common cold, but you can take commonsense
        precautions to slow the spread of cold viruses:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Wash your hands:</b> Clean your hands thoroughly and often with
          soap and water, and teach your children the importance of
          hand-washing. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based
          hand sanitizer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Disinfect your stuff:</b> Clean kitchen and bathroom countertops.
          Use tissues. Sneeze and cough into tissues, and discard them right
          away.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Teach children:</b> Teach children to sneeze or cough into the bend
          of their elbow when they don’t have a tissue.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Don't share:</b> Don't share drinking glasses or utensils with
          others. Use your own glass or disposable cups when you or someone else
          is sick.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Steer clear of colds:</b> Avoid close contact with anyone who has a
          cold.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Child care settings:</b> Choose child care settings with good
          hygiene practices and clear policies about keeping sick children at
          home.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Take care of yourself:</b> Eating well, getting exercise, enough
          sleep, and managing stress might help you keep colds at bay.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Diagnosis</b></p>

      <p>
        Most people with a common cold can be diagnosed by their signs and
        symptoms. If your doctor suspects you have a bacterial infection or
        other condition, they may order a chest X-ray or other tests.
      </p>

      <p><b>Treatment</b></p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          There's no cure for the common cold. Antibiotics are of no use against
          cold viruses and shouldn't be used unless there's a bacterial
          infection. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Pain relievers:</b> For fever, sore throat, and headache, many
          people use acetaminophen (Tylenol) or other mild pain relievers.
          Follow the label directions to avoid side effects.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Use caution with aspirin:</b> Avoid giving aspirin to children or
          teenagers recovering from flu-like symptoms or chickenpox due to the
          risk of Reye's syndrome.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Over-the-counter pain medications:</b> For children, consider using
          acetaminophen (Children's Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Children's Advil) to
          ease symptoms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Decongestant nasal sprays:</b> Adults can use decongestant drops or
          sprays for up to five days. Prolonged use can cause rebound symptoms.
          Children younger than 6 shouldn't use decongestant drops or sprays.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cough syrups:</b> The FDA and the American Academy of Pediatrics
          recommend against giving OTC cough and cold medicines to children
          under 4 years old.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Lifestyle and home remedies</b></p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Drink fluids:</b> Stay hydrated with water, juice, clear broth, or
          warm lemon water. Avoid caffeine and alcohol.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Eat chicken soup:</b> Chicken soup can be soothing and loosen
          congestion.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Rest:</b> Stay home if you have a fever or bad cough to rest and
          avoid spreading the cold to others.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Humidity:</b> Use a cool-mist humidifier to moisten the air and
          ease congestion and coughing. Keep the humidifier clean to avoid mold
          and bacteria growth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Soothing your throat:</b> Gargle with salt water (1/4 to 1/2
          teaspoon salt in a glass of warm water) to relieve a sore throat.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Saline nasal drops:</b> Use saline drops to help relieve nasal
          congestion. For infants, gently suction the nostrils with a bulb
          syringe after applying saline drops.
        </li>
      </ul>
