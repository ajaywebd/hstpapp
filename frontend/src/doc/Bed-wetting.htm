      <h1>Bed-wetting</h1>

      <p>
        Bed-wetting — also called nighttime incontinence or nocturnal enuresis —
        is involuntary urination while asleep after the age at which staying dry
        at night can be reasonably expected.
      </p>

      <p>
        Soggy sheets and pajamas — and an embarrassed child — are a familiar
        scene in many homes. But don't despair. Bed-wetting isn't a sign of
        toilet training gone bad. It's often just a normal part of a child's
        development.
      </p>

      <p>
        Generally, bed-wetting before age 7 isn't a concern. At this age, your
        child may still be developing nighttime bladder control.
      </p>

      <p>
        If bed-wetting continues, treat the problem with patience and
        understanding. Lifestyle changes, bladder training, moisture alarms, and
        sometimes medication may help reduce bed-wetting.
      </p>

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>

      <p>
        Most kids are fully toilet trained by age 5, but there's really no
        target date for developing complete bladder control. Between the ages of
        5 and 7, bed-wetting remains a problem for some children. After 7 years
        of age, a small number of children still wet the bed.
      </p>

      <h2>Causes</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>A small bladder.</strong> Your child's bladder may not be
          developed enough to hold urine produced during the night.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Inability to recognize a full bladder.</strong> If the nerves
          that control the bladder are slow to mature, a full bladder may not
          wake your child — especially if your child is a deep sleeper.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A hormone imbalance.</strong> During childhood, some kids
          don't produce enough anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) to slow nighttime
          urine production.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Urinary tract infection.</strong> This infection can make it
          difficult for your child to control urination. Signs and symptoms may
          include bed-wetting, daytime accidents, frequent urination, red or
          pink urine, and pain during urination.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sleep apnea.</strong> Sometimes bed-wetting is a sign of
          obstructive sleep apnea, a condition in which the child's breathing is
          interrupted during sleep — often due to inflamed or enlarged tonsils
          or adenoids. Other signs and symptoms may include snoring and daytime
          drowsiness.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Diabetes.</strong> For a child who's usually dry at night,
          bed-wetting may be the first sign of diabetes. Other signs and
          symptoms may include passing large amounts of urine at once, increased
          thirst, fatigue, and weight loss despite a good appetite.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chronic constipation.</strong> The same muscles are used to
          control urine and stool elimination. When constipation is long-term,
          these muscles can become dysfunctional and contribute to bed-wetting
          at night.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >A structural problem in the urinary tract or nervous
            system.</strong
          >
          Rarely, bed-wetting is related to a defect in the child's neurological
          system or urinary system.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Risk factors</h2>

      <p>
        Bed-wetting can affect anyone, but it's twice as common in boys as in
        girls. Several factors have been associated with an increased risk of
        bed-wetting, including:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Stress and anxiety.</strong> Stressful events — such as
          becoming a big brother or sister, starting a new school, or sleeping
          away from home — may trigger bed-wetting.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Family history.</strong> If one or both of a child's parents
          wet the bed as children, their child has a significant chance of
          wetting the bed, too.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</strong>
          Bed-wetting is more common in children who have ADHD.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Complications</h2>

      <p>
        Although frustrating, bed-wetting without a physical cause doesn't pose
        any health risks. However, bed-wetting can create some issues for your
        child, including:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Guilt and embarrassment,</strong> which can lead to low
          self-esteem.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Loss of opportunities for social activities,</strong> such as
          sleepovers and camp.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rashes on the child's bottom and genital area</strong> —
          especially if your child sleeps in wet underwear.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>

      <p>
        Depending on the circumstances, your doctor may recommend the following
        to identify any underlying cause of bed-wetting and help determine
        treatment:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Physical exam.</strong></li>
        <li>
          Discussion of symptoms, fluid intake, family history, bowel and
          bladder habits, and problems associated with bed-wetting.
        </li>
        <li>Urine tests to check for signs of an infection or diabetes.</li>
        <li>
          X-rays or other imaging tests of the kidneys or bladder to look at the
          structure of the urinary tract.
        </li>
        <li>Other types of urinary tract tests or assessments, as needed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>

      <p>
        Most children outgrow bed-wetting on their own. If treatment is needed,
        it can be based on a discussion of options with your doctor and
        identifying what will work best for your situation.
      </p>

      <p>
        If your child isn't especially bothered or embarrassed by an occasional
        wet night, lifestyle changes — such as avoiding caffeine entirely and
        limiting fluid intake in the evening — may work well. However, if
        lifestyle changes aren't successful or if your grade schooler is
        terrified about wetting the bed, he or she may be helped by additional
        treatments.
      </p>

      <p>
        If found, underlying causes of bed-wetting, such as constipation or
        sleep apnea, should be addressed before other treatment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Options for treating bed-wetting may include moisture alarms and
        medication.
      </p>

      <h3>Moisture alarms</h3>

      <p>
        These small, battery-operated devices — available without a prescription
        at most pharmacies — connect to a moisture-sensitive pad on your child's
        pajamas or bedding. When the pad senses wetness, the alarm goes off.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ideally, the moisture alarm sounds just as your child begins to urinate
        — in time to help your child wake, stop the urine stream, and get to the
        toilet. If your child is a heavy sleeper, another person may need to
        listen for the alarm and wake the child.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you try a moisture alarm, give it plenty of time. It often takes one
        to three months to see any type of response and up to 16 weeks to
        achieve dry nights. Moisture alarms are effective for many children,
        carry a low risk of relapse or side effects, and may provide a better
        long-term solution than medication does.
      </p>

      <h3>Medication</h3>

      <p>
        As a last resort, your child's doctor may prescribe medication for a
        short period of time to stop bed-wetting. Certain types of medication
        can:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Slow nighttime urine production.</strong> The drug
          desmopressin (DDAVP) reduces urine production at night.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Calm the bladder.</strong> An anticholinergic drug such as
          oxybutynin (Ditropan XL) may help reduce bladder contractions and
          increase bladder capacity, especially if daytime wetting also occurs.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Lifestyle and home remedies</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Limit fluids in the evening.</strong> Encourage your child to
          drink liquids earlier in the day to reduce thirst in the evening, but
          don’t limit fluids if your child participates in evening sports
          activities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Avoid beverages and foods with caffeine.</strong> Caffeine may
          stimulate the bladder, so it's discouraged for children, especially in
          the evening.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Encourage double voiding before bed.</strong> Double voiding
          is urinating at the start of the bedtime routine and again before
          falling asleep.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Encourage regular toilet use throughout the day.</strong>
          Suggest that your child urinate every two hours or so to avoid feeling
          urgent.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prevent rashes.</strong> Help your child rinse the affected
          area every morning and use a protective moisture barrier cream if
          necessary.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Alternative medicine</h2>

      <p>
        Some people may choose complementary or alternative medicine approaches
        to treat bed-wetting. For approaches such as hypnosis, acupuncture,
        chiropractic therapy, and herbal therapy, evidence of effectiveness is
        weak and inconclusive.
      </p>

      <p>
        Talk to your child's doctor before starting any complementary or
        alternative therapy. Ensure it’s safe for your child and won't interact
        with any medications.
      </p>

      <h2>Coping and support</h2>

      <p>
        Children don’t wet the bed to irritate their parents. Patience is key as
        you work through the problem together. Effective treatment may include
        several strategies and may take time to be successful.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Be sensitive to your child's feelings.</strong> Encourage your
        child to express feelings of stress or anxiety and offer support and
        encouragement. Bed-wetting may become less problematic as they feel
        calmer.
      </p>

      <h2>Practical steps</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Plan for easy cleanup.</strong> Cover the mattress with a
          plastic cover and keep extra bedding and pajamas handy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enlist your child's help.</strong> Encourage your child to
          rinse their wet items or put them in a specific container for washing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Celebrate effort.</strong> Praise your child for following the
          bedtime routine and helping with cleanup after accidents. Avoid
          punishment or teasing.
        </li>
      </ul>
