      <h1>Acne</h1>
      <p>
        Acne is the term for plugged pores, pimples, and deeper lumps that occur
        on the face, neck, chest, back, shoulders, and even the upper arms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Acne is very common: nearly 17 million people in the US are affected by
        this condition. Acne most often begins in puberty. During puberty, the
        male sex hormones increase in both boys and girls, causing the sebaceous
        glands to become more active. This, in turn, causes the sebaceous glands
        to produce more sebum, or oil.
      </p>

      <h2>How does acne develop?</h2>
      <p>
        Acne is caused by clogged sebaceous glands in the pores of the skin. The
        sebaceous glands produce oil (sebum), which normally travels via hair
        follicles to the skin surface. If skin cells plug the follicles,
        blocking the oil, skin bacteria (called <i>Propionibacterium acnes</i>,
        or <i>P. acnes</i>) grow inside the follicles, causing inflammation.
        Acne progresses in the following manner:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Incomplete blockage of the hair follicle results in blackheads (a
          semisolid, black plug).
        </li>
        <li>
          Complete blockage of the hair follicle results in whiteheads (a
          semisolid, white plug).
        </li>
        <li>Infection and irritation cause whiteheads to form.</li>
        <li>
          The plugged follicle bursts, spilling oil, skin cells, and bacteria
          onto the skin surface. In turn, the skin becomes irritated and pimples
          or lesions develop.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Causes</h3>
      <p>
        Rising hormone levels during puberty may cause acne. In addition, acne
        is often inherited. Other causes of acne may include the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Hormone level changes during the menstrual cycle in girls and women
        </li>
        <li>
          Certain drugs (such as corticosteroids, lithium, or barbiturates)
        </li>
        <li>
          Oil and grease from the scalp, mineral or cooking oil, and certain
          cosmetics may worsen acne
        </li>
        <li>Bacteria inside pimples</li>
        <li>
          Squeezing the pimples or scrubbing the skin too hard can aggravate
          acne
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Symptoms</h3>
      <p>
        Acne can occur anywhere on the body. However, it usually appears in
        areas where there is a high concentration of sebaceous glands,
        including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Face</li>
        <li>Chest</li>
        <li>Upper back</li>
        <li>Shoulders</li>
        <li>Neck</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The following are the most common signs/symptoms of acne. However, each
        child may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Blackheads</li>
        <li>Whiteheads</li>
        <li>Pus-filled lesions that may be painful</li>
        <li>Nodules (solid, raised bumps)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Treatment</h3>
      <p>
        Acne treatment is designed to minimize scarring and improve the
        appearance of the skin. The specific treatment will be determined based
        on the following factors:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The severity of the acne</li>
        <li>The adolescent's age, overall health, and medical history</li>
        <li>
          The adolescent's tolerance for specific medications, procedures, or
          therapies
        </li>
        <li>Expectations for the course of the condition</li>
        <li>The patient’s or parent’s opinion or preference</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Acne treatment may include topical or systemic drug therapy. Depending
        on the severity of the acne, the doctor may prescribe medications that
        are applied to the skin (topical) or medications taken orally
        (systemic). In some cases, a combination of both types of medications
        may be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        Topical medications come in creams, gels, lotions, or solutions.
        Specific topical medications that are used to treat acne include the
        following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Benzoyl peroxide (kills the bacteria)</li>
        <li>
          Antibiotics (helps stop or slow down the growth of <i>P. acnes</i> and
          reduces inflammation)
        </li>
        <li>
          Tretinoin (stops the development of new acne lesions and encourages
          cell turnover, unplugging pimples)
        </li>
        <li>Adapalene (decreases acne formation)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Systemic medications, which can be used to treat moderate to severe
        acne, include the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Doxycycline</li>
        <li>Erythromycin</li>
        <li>Tetracycline</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If the acne is severe, cystic, or inflammatory, doctors may prescribe
        Isotretinoin (Accutane®), an oral medication that can reduce the size of
        the sebaceous glands that produce the skin oil, increase skin cell
        shedding, and affect the hair follicles to reduce the development of
        acne lesions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Isotretinoin can clear acne in 90 percent of patients, but the drug has
        major unwanted side effects, including psychiatric symptoms. It is very
        important to discuss this prescription medication with a physician prior
        to use.
