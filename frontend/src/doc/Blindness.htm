      <h1>Blindness</h1>

      <p>
        Blindness is the inability to see anything, even light. If you're
        partially blind, you have limited vision. For example, you may have
        blurry vision or the inability to distinguish the shapes of objects.
        Complete blindness means that you can't see at all and are in total
        darkness. Legal blindness refers to vision that's highly compromised.
        What a person with healthy eyes can see from 200 feet away, a legally
        blind person can see only from 20 feet away.
      </p>

      <p>
        Seek medical attention right away if you suddenly lose the ability to
        see. Have someone bring you to the emergency room for treatment. Don't
        wait for your vision to return. Depending on the cause of your
        blindness, immediate treatment may increase your chances of restoring
        your vision. Treatment may involve surgery or medication.
      </p>

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>

      <p>
        If you're completely blind, you can see nothing. If you're partially
        blind, you might experience the following symptoms:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Cloudy vision</li>
        <li>An inability to see shapes</li>
        <li>Seeing only shadows</li>
        <li>Poor night vision</li>
        <li>Tunnel vision</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Symptoms of Blindness in Infants</h2>

      <p>
        Your child's visual system begins to develop in the womb, but it won't
        be fully formed until about 2 years of age. By 6 to 8 weeks of age, your
        baby should be able to fix their gaze on an object and follow its
        movement. By 4 months of age, their eyes should be properly aligned and
        not turned inward or outward.
      </p>

      <h3>The symptoms of visual impairment in young children can include:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Constant eye rubbing</li>
        <li>An extreme sensitivity to light</li>
        <li>Poor focusing</li>
        <li>Chronic eye redness</li>
        <li>Chronic tearing from their eyes</li>
        <li>A white instead of a black pupil</li>
        <li>
          Poor visual tracking, or trouble following an object with their eyes
        </li>
        <li>Abnormal eye alignment or movement after 6 months of age</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Causes</h2>

      <p>The following eye diseases and conditions can cause blindness:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Glaucoma refers to four different eye conditions that can damage your
          optic nerve, which carries visual information from your eyes to your
          brain.
        </li>
        <li>
          Macular degeneration destroys the part of your eye that enables you to
          see details. It usually affects older adults.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cataracts cause cloudy vision. They’re more common in older people.
        </li>
        <li>
          A lazy eye can make it difficult to see details. It may lead to vision
          loss.
        </li>
        <li>
          Optic neuritis is inflammation that can cause temporary or permanent
          vision loss.
        </li>
        <li>
          Retinitis pigmentosa refers to damage of the retina. It leads to
          blindness only in rare cases.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tumors that affect your retina or optic nerve can also cause
          blindness.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Blindness is a potential complication if you have diabetes or have a
        stroke. Birth defects, eye injuries, and complications from eye surgery
        are other common causes of blindness.
      </p>

      <h2>Causes of Blindness in Infants</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Infections, such as pinkeye</li>
        <li>Blocked tear ducts</li>
        <li>Cataracts</li>
        <li>Strabismus, or crossed eyes</li>
        <li>Amblyopia, or a lazy eye</li>
        <li>Ptosis, or a droopy eyelid</li>
        <li>Congenital glaucoma</li>
        <li>
          Retinopathy of prematurity, which occurs in premature babies when the
          blood vessels that supply their retina aren't fully developed
        </li>
        <li>
          Visual inattention, or delayed development of your child's visual
          system
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Risk Factors</h3>

      <p>The following categories of people are at risk of blindness:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          People with eye diseases, such as macular degeneration and glaucoma
        </li>
        <li>People with diabetes</li>
        <li>People who have a stroke</li>
        <li>Eye surgery patients</li>
        <li>People who work with or near sharp objects or toxic chemicals</li>
        <li>Premature babies</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>

      <p>
        A thorough eye exam by an optometrist will help to determine the cause
        of your blindness or partial loss of vision. Your eye doctor will
        administer a series of tests that measure the clarity of your vision,
        the function of your eye muscles, and how your pupils react to light.
        They'll examine the general health of your eyes using a slit lamp, which
        is a low-power microscope paired with a high-intensity light.
      </p>

      <h3>Diagnosing Blindness in Infants</h3>

      <p>
        A pediatrician will screen your baby for eye problems shortly after
        birth. At 6 months of age, you should have an eye doctor or pediatrician
        check your child again for visual acuity, focus, and eye alignment. The
        doctor will look at your baby's eye structures and see whether they can
        follow a light or colorful object with their eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your child should be able to pay attention to visual stimuli by 6 to 8
        weeks of age. If your child doesn't react to light shining in their eyes
        or focus on colorful objects by 2 to 3 months of age, have their eyes
        examined right away. You should have their eyes examined if you notice
        crossed eyes or any other symptoms of impaired vision.
      </p>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>

      <p>
        In some cases of vision impairment, one or more of the following may
        help to restore your vision:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Eyeglasses</li>
        <li>Contact lenses</li>
        <li>Surgery</li>
        <li>Medication</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you experience partial blindness that can't be corrected, your doctor
        will provide guidance on how to function with limited vision. For
        example, you can use a magnifying glass to read, increase the text size
        on your computer, and use audio clocks and audiobooks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Complete blindness requires approaching life in a new way and learning
        new skills. For example, you may need to learn how to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Read Braille</li>
        <li>Use a guide dog</li>
        <li>Memorize the keypad on your phone</li>
        <li>Organize your home so you can find things easily</li>
        <li>Fold money in distinct ways to distinguish bill amounts</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You may also need to have handrails installed in your bathroom.</p>

      <h2>Outlook</h2>

      <p>
        The long-term outlook for restoring vision and slowing vision loss is
        better when treatment is preventive and sought immediately. Cataracts
        can be treated effectively with surgery and don't necessarily result in
        blindness. Early diagnosis and treatment are also important in cases of
        glaucoma and macular degeneration to help slow down or stop your vision
        loss.
      </p>

      <h2>Prevention</h2>

      <p>
        To detect eye diseases and help prevent vision loss, get regular eye
        examinations. If you're diagnosed with certain eye conditions, such as
        glaucoma, treatment with medication can help prevent blindness.
