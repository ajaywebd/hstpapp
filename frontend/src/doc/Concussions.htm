      <h1><b>Concussions</b></h1>

      <p>
        You've probably bumped your head before. Ouch! But some head bumps are
        worse than others. A serious hit to the head can hurt your brain and
        temporarily change the way your brain works. If that happens, the brain
        injury is called a concussion (say: kun-KUH-shun).
      </p>

      <p>
        The bone of your skull protects your brain. Fluids, such as spinal
        fluid, also cushion the brain. But if someone's head gets hit hard
        enough, the brain can shift inside of the skull and knock against the
        bony surface of the skull.
      </p>

      <p><b>Signs of a Concussion</b></p>

      <p>
        Concussions are tricky. Your mom or coach probably won't be able to look
        at you and say for sure if you have a concussion. That's why you need to
        see a doctor.
      </p>

      <p>
        But there are some signs that someone might have a concussion. For some
        problems, the person should go right to a hospital emergency room. For
        other problems, a parent can call the kid's doctor for advice about what
        to do next.
      </p>

      <p>Go to a hospital emergency room for these symptoms:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Loss of consciousness (knocked out)</li>
        <li>Severe headache, including a headache that gets worse</li>
        <li>Blurred vision</li>
        <li>Trouble walking</li>
        <li>Confusion and saying things that don't make sense</li>
        <li>Slurred speech</li>
        <li>Unresponsive (can't be woken up)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Your mom or dad should call the doctor right away if you have any of
        these symptoms after getting hit in the head:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Vomiting</li>
        <li>Dizziness</li>
        <li>Headache</li>
        <li>Trouble concentrating</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Doctors, coaches, and parents are paying more attention to concussions
        than they once did. Why? Because they now know that concussions can
        cause serious problems for kids and adults, especially if they don't get
        the right treatment.
      </p>

      <p><b>Two Important Steps to Take</b></p>

      <p>
        The right treatment usually means resting your body and your brain.
        You've probably heard about pro athletes who must miss some games after
        a concussion. It's the same for kids who play sports.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the coach or your parent thinks you could have a concussion, you must
        take these two steps:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Stop playing or practicing right away.</li>
        <li>
          Get checked out by a doctor before returning to practice or play in a
          game.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Kids can get concussions doing stuff other than sports, too. It could be
        a bike accident or a fall that causes a concussion — anything that
        causes a hit to the head. Kids who get a concussion need to get checked
        out by a doctor, follow the doctor's instructions, and get the doctor's
        OK before getting back to their normal routine.
      </p>

      <p><b>Protect Your Brain</b></p>

      <p>
        You might hear this and say: Do I have to? Here's why you should: Kids
        who rush it and don't recover fully from a concussion could get injured
        again because they're still wobbly from the first concussion. When kids
        don't recover fully, they are more likely to have problems, like
        headaches, that last for weeks or even months. It also can be hard for
        them to focus on stuff, like studying for a test.
      </p>

      <p>
        It makes sense to take care of your brain, which is the boss of your
        body. Without it, you couldn't walk, talk, or think!
      </p>

      <p>Want to be a concussion fighter? Here's how to do it:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Tell your coach or parent if you get hit in the head.</li>
        <li>Wear your seatbelt when you're traveling in a car.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Also, wear a helmet when biking or doing other activities that need
        them, such as football, hockey, and skateboarding. Though a helmet can't
        prevent a concussion, it can prevent you from getting an even worse
        brain injury.
      </p>

      <p>
        The good news is that most kids get better after a concussion and return
        to all their normal stuff, including school and sports.
      </p>

      <p><b>Treatment</b></p>

      <p>
        The best treatment for a concussion is complete rest from all physical
        and mental activity. Children should be monitored often, but there is no
        need for wake-up checks during sleep. Loud music, computer, and TV
        should be limited or stopped if they increase the symptoms. School
        attendance and work may need to be modified with tests and projects
        postponed. Students need to be excused from gym class or recess
        activities. Any worsening of concussion symptoms or changes in behavior
        (e.g., agitation, grogginess, disorientation) should be immediately
        reported to your doctor.
      </p>

      <p><b>Prevention</b></p>

      <p>
        Not all concussions can be prevented, but some may be avoided. Helmets
        should be worn for any riding activities (like horseback, ATV,
        motorbike, bike, skateboard, or snowboard) or contact sports (like
        football, hockey, or lacrosse). Helmets should fit appropriately and be
        in good condition. Athletes should be taught safe playing techniques and
        to follow the rules of the game. Most importantly, every athlete needs
        to know how crucial it is to let their coach, athletic trainer, or
        parent know if they have hit their head or have symptoms of a head
        injury—even if it means stopping play. Never ignore a head injury, no
        matter how minor.
