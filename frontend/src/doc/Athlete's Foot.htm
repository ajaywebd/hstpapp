      <h1>Athlete's Foot</h1>
      <p>
        Athlete's foot — also called tinea pedis — is a contagious fungal
        infection that affects the skin on the feet. It can also spread to the
        toenails and the hands. The fungal infection is called athlete's foot
        because it's commonly seen in athletes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Athlete's foot isn't serious, but sometimes it's hard to cure. If you
        have diabetes or a weakened immune system and suspect you have athlete's
        foot, you should call your doctor right away.
      </p>

      <h2>Causes</h2>
      <p>
        Athlete's foot occurs when the tinea fungus grows on the feet. You can
        catch the fungus through direct contact with an infected person, or by
        touching surfaces contaminated with the fungus. The fungus thrives in
        warm, moist environments. It’s commonly found in showers, on locker room
        floors, and around swimming pools.
      </p>

      <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
      <p>
        Anyone can get athlete’s foot, but certain behaviors increase your risk.
        Factors that increase your risk of getting athlete’s foot include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Visiting public places barefoot, especially locker rooms, showers, and
          swimming pools
        </li>
        <li>Sharing socks, shoes, or towels with an infected person</li>
        <li>Wearing tight-fitting, closed-toe shoes</li>
        <li>Keeping your feet wet for long periods of time</li>
        <li>Having sweaty feet</li>
        <li>Having a minor skin or nail injury on your foot</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>
      <p>There are many possible symptoms of athlete’s foot, which include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Itching, stinging, and burning between the toes</li>
        <li>Itching, stinging, and burning on the soles of the feet</li>
        <li>Blisters on the feet that itch</li>
        <li>
          Cracking and peeling skin on the feet, most commonly between the toes
          and on the soles
        </li>
        <li>Dry skin on the soles or sides of the feet</li>
        <li>Raw skin on the feet</li>
        <li>Discolored, thick, and crumbly toenails</li>
        <li>Toenails that pull away from the nail bed</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
      <p>
        A doctor may diagnose athlete's foot by the symptoms. Or, a doctor may
        order a skin test if they aren't sure a fungal infection is causing your
        symptoms.
      </p>
      <p>
        A skin lesion potassium hydroxide (KOH) exam is the most common test for
        athlete’s foot. A doctor scrapes off a small area of infected skin and
        places it in potassium hydroxide (KOH). The KOH destroys normal cells
        and leaves the fungal cells untouched so they are easy to see under a
        microscope.
      </p>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
      <p>
        Athlete’s foot can often be treated with over-the-counter (OTC) topical
        antifungal medications. If OTC medications don’t treat the fungal
        infection, your doctor may prescribe topical or oral
        prescription-strength antifungal medications. Your doctor may also
        recommend home treatments to help clear up the infection.
      </p>

      <h3>OTC Medications</h3>
      <p>There are many OTC topical antifungal medications, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Miconazole (Desenex)</li>
        <li>Terbinafine (Lamisil AT)</li>
        <li>Clotrimazole (Lotrimin AF)</li>
        <li>Butenafine (Lotrimin Ultra)</li>
        <li>Tolnaftate (Tinactin)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Prescription Medications</h3>
      <p>
        Some of the prescription medications your doctor may prescribe for
        athlete's foot include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Topical, prescription-strength clotrimazole or miconazole</li>
        <li>
          Oral antifungal medications such as itraconazole (Sporanox),
          fluconazole (Diflucan), or prescription-strength terbinafine (Lamisil)
        </li>
        <li>Topical steroid medications to reduce painful inflammation</li>
        <li>
          Oral antibiotics if bacterial infections develop due to raw skin and
          blisters
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Complications</h2>
      <p>
        Athlete’s foot can lead to complications in some cases. Mild
        complications include an allergic reaction to the fungus, which can lead
        to blistering on the feet or hands. It’s also possible for the fungal
        infection to return after treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
        More severe complications can occur if a secondary bacterial infection
        develops. In this case, your foot might be swollen, painful, and hot.
        Pus, drainage, and fever are additional signs of a bacterial infection.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bacterial infection can spread to the lymph system. A skin infection
        could lead to lymphangitis (infection of the lymph vessels) or
        lymphadenitis (infection of the lymph nodes).
      </p>

      <h2>Prevention</h2>
      <p>
        There are several things you can do to help prevent athlete’s foot
        infections. These include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Wash your feet with soap and water every day and dry them thoroughly,
          especially between the toes.
        </li>
        <li>
          To kill the fungus, wash in 140°F (60°C) water or higher. Combining
          washing with OTC antifungal medications should treat most cases of
          athlete’s foot. You can disinfect shoes using disinfectant wipes or
          sprays.
        </li>
        <li>Put antifungal powder on your feet every day.</li>
        <li>Don't share socks, shoes, or towels with others.</li>
        <li>
          Wear sandals in public showers, around public swimming pools, and in
          other public places.
        </li>
        <li>
          Wear socks made out of breathable fibers, such as cotton or wool, or
          synthetic fibers that wick moisture away from your skin.
        </li>
        <li>Change your socks when your feet get sweaty.</li>
        <li>Air out your feet when you are at home by going barefoot.</li>
        <li>Wear shoes made of breathable materials.</li>
        <li>
          Alternate between two pairs of shoes, wearing each pair every other
          day to give your shoes time to dry out between uses. Moisture will
          allow the fungus to continue to grow.
        </li>
      </ul>
