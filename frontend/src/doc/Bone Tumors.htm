      <h1><b>Bone Tumors</b></h1>

      <p>
        Children's National Health System has a team of individuals who are
        highly skilled and experienced in the treatment of bone tumors,
        including osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma. Children's patients have
        access to the most current therapies in treating pediatric cancer
        through Childrenâ€™s Oncology Group's protocols and other clinical trials.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, the Patient and Family Support Program Cancer and Blood
        Disorders provides comprehensive mental health and psychosocial services
        and helpful resources for all patients treated in the Center for Cancer
        Blood Disorders, as well as patients' parents and siblings.
      </p>

      <p><b>Ewing Sarcoma</b></p>

      <p>
        Ewing sarcoma is a cancer that occurs primarily in the bone or soft
        tissue. Ewing sarcoma can occur in any bone but is most often found in
        the extremities and can involve muscle and the soft tissues around the
        tumor site. Ewing sarcoma cells can also spread (metastasize) to other
        areas of the body including the bone marrow, lungs, kidneys, heart,
        adrenal gland, and other soft tissues. Ewing sarcoma accounts for about
        1.8 percent of childhood cancers. About 150 children and adolescents are
        diagnosed with Ewing sarcoma each year in the US. It is the second most
        common malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents. Ewing sarcoma
        most often occurs in children between the ages of 5 and 20. The number
        of males affected is slightly higher than the number of females.
      </p>

      <p><b>Causes for Ewing Sarcoma</b></p>

      <p>
        The majority of Ewing sarcomas result from a chromosome rearrangement
        between chromosomes #11 and #22. This rearrangement changes the position
        and function of genes, causing a fusion of genes referred to as a fusion
        transcript. Over 90 percent of individuals have an abnormal fusion
        transcript, involving two genes known as EWS and FLI1. This important
        discovery has led to improvements in diagnosing Ewing sarcoma. Similar
        to osteogenic sarcoma, trauma or injury is sometimes involved with the
        site at the time of diagnosis. However, this trauma is thought to bring
        the condition to attention rather than to have any causal relationship.
        Some physicians classify Ewing sarcoma as a primitive neuroectodermal
        tumor (PNET). This means the tumor may have started in fetal, or
        embryonic, tissue that has developed into nerve tissue.
      </p>

      <p><b>Symptoms of Ewing Sarcoma</b></p>

      <p>
        The following are the most common symptoms of Ewing sarcoma. However,
        each child may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may include,
        but are not limited to, the following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Pain around the site of the tumor</li>
        <li>Swelling and/or redness around the site of the tumor</li>
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Weight loss, decreased appetite</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>
          Paralysis and/or incontinence if the tumor is in the spinal region
        </li>
        <li>
          Numbness, tingling, paralysis, and other symptoms related to nerve
          compression from the tumor
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The symptoms of Ewing sarcoma may resemble other conditions or medical
        problems. Always consult your child's physician for a diagnosis.
      </p>

      <p><b>Ewing Sarcoma Diagnosis</b></p>

      <p>
        In addition to a complete medical history and physical examination of
        your child, diagnostic procedures for Ewing sarcoma may include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>X-rays:</b> use invisible electromagnetic energy beams to produce
          images of internal tissues, bones, and organs onto film. This test is
          used to measure and evaluate the curve.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Bone scans:</b> are a nuclear imaging method that evaluates any
          degenerative and/or arthritic changes in the joints. Bone scans detect
          bone diseases and tumors, determine the cause of bone pain or
          inflammation, and rule out any infection or fractures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):</b> is a diagnostic procedure
          that uses a combination of large magnets, radiofrequencies, and a
          computer to produce detailed images of organs and structures within
          the body. This test is done to rule out any associated abnormalities
          of the spinal cord and nerves.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Computer-assisted tomography scan (CT or CAT scan):</b> is a
          diagnostic imaging procedure that uses a combination of x-rays and
          computer technology to produce cross-sectional images, both
          horizontally and vertically, of the body. CT scans show detailed
          images of any part of the body, including the bones, muscles, fat, and
          organs. CT scans are more detailed than general x-rays.
        </li>
        <li><b>Blood tests:</b> including blood chemistries.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Biopsy:</b> of the tumor, which uses invisible electromagnetic
          energy beams to produce images of internal tissues, bones, and organs
          onto film.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy:</b> This procedure involves
          taking a small amount of bone marrow fluid (aspiration) and/or solid
          bone marrow tissue (called a core biopsy), usually from the hip bones,
          to be examined for the number, size, and maturity of blood cells
          and/or abnormal cells.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Ewing sarcoma is difficult to distinguish from other similar tumors.
        Diagnosis is often made by excluding all other common solid tumors and
        by the use of genetic studies.
      </p>

      <p><b>Osteogenic Sarcoma</b></p>

      <p>
        Also called osteosarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma is one of the most common
        types of bone cancer in children and accounts for nearly 3 percent of
        all childhood cancers. About 400 children are diagnosed with
        osteosarcoma each year. The disease usually occurs in the long bones,
        such as the arms (humerus), legs (femur/tibia), and pelvis. It rarely
        occurs in the jaw and fingers, but often occurs at the ends of these
        bones near growth plates. Osteosarcoma affects children most often
        between 10 and 25 years of age. This cancer is also more prevalent in
        males than in females, possibly because of the rapid growth rate at this
        age. Prior to adolescence, the percentage of affected males and females
        is equal. Osteogenic sarcoma cancer cells can also spread (metastasize)
        to other areas of the body. Most commonly, these cells spread to the
        lungs. However, bones, kidneys, the adrenal gland, the brain, and the
        heart can also be sites of metastasis.
      </p>

      <p><b>What causes osteogenic sarcoma?</b></p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Repeated trauma:</b> It has been suggested that repeated trauma to
          an area may be a risk factor for developing this type of cancer. It is
          uncertain whether trauma is a cause or effect of the disease. Cancer
          lesions in the bone can make that area of the bone weaker, thus making
          injury more likely. However, repeated injuries to a certain area of
          the bone may lead to an increased production of osteoid tissue to
          repair the damaged area. The rapid production of osteoid tissue may
          lead to the malignancy. It is thought, most often, that injury simply
          brings the condition to attention and has no causal relationship.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Genetics:</b> Genetics may play an important role in developing
          osteosarcoma. Children and adults with other hereditary abnormalities,
          including exostoses (bony growths), retinoblastoma, Ollier's disease,
          osteogenesis imperfecta, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, and Paget's
          disease, have an increased risk developing osteosarcoma.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Exposure to ionizing irradiation:</b> This form of cancer has also
          been linked to exposure to ionizing irradiation associated with
          radiation therapy for other types of cancer (i.e., Hodgkin and
          non-Hodgkin disease).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Symptoms of Osteogenic Sarcoma</b></p>

      <p>
        The following are the most common symptoms of osteogenic sarcoma.
        However, each child may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may
        include, but are not limited to, the following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Pain (sharp or dull) at the site of the tumor</li>
        <li>Swelling and/or redness at the site of the tumor</li>
        <li>Increased pain with activity or lifting</li>
        <li>Limping</li>
        <li>Decreased movement of the affected limb</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The symptoms may have been present over a short period of time or may
        have been occurring for six months or more. Often, an injury brings a
        child into a medical facility where an x-ray may indicate suspicious
        bone lesions. The symptoms of osteogenic sarcoma may resemble other
        conditions or medical problems. Always consult your child's physician
        for a diagnosis.
      </p>

      <p><b>Treatment</b></p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The specialists at Children's National Health System aim not only to
          cure the cancer, but also to minimize the side effects of treatment.
          Specific treatment for a bone tumor will be determined by a child's
          physician based on the:
        </li>
        <li>Child's age, overall health, and medical history</li>
        <li>Type, location, and size of the tumor</li>
        <li>Extent of the disease</li>
        <li>Treatment may include one or more of the following:</li>
        <li>Surgery</li>
        <li>Cyberknife therapy</li>
        <li>Radiation therapy</li>
        <li>Amputation</li>
        <li>
          Resections for metastases, such as pulmonary resections of cancer
          cells in the lung
        </li>
        <li>
          Rehabilitation including physical and Occupational therapy, and
          psychosocial adaptation
        </li>
        <li>Prosthesis fitting and training</li>
        <li>Antibiotics to prevent and treat infections</li>
        <li>
          Continual follow-up care to determine response to treatment, detect
          recurrent disease, and manage late effects of treatment
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Long-term outlook</b></p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The factors for determining the prognosis and long-term survival of
          children with Ewing sarcoma or osteosarcoma include the following:
          Prognosis greatly depends on the:
        </li>
        <li>Child's age</li>
        <li>Extent of the disease (presence or absence of metastasis)</li>
        <li>Other factors that may play a role in the outcome include:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Size and location of the tumor</li>
          <li>Tumor's response to therapy</li>
          <li>
            Child's tolerance of specific medications, procedures, or therapies
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <p>
        As with any cancer, prognosis and long-term survival can vary greatly
        from child to child. Every child is unique, and treatment and prognosis
        are structured around the child's needs. Prompt medical attention and
        aggressive therapy are important for the best prognosis. Continuous
        follow-up care is essential. Late effects of radiation and chemotherapy,
        as well as second malignancies, can occur in survivors of Ewing sarcoma
        and osteosarcoma. New methods are continually being discovered to
        improve treatment and to decrease side effects.
