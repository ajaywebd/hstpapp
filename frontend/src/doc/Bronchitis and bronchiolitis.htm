      <h1><b>Bronchitis and Bronchiolitis</b></h1>

      <p>
        <b>Bronchitis</b> is an inflammation of the lining of your bronchial
        tubes, which carry air to and from your lungs. People who have
        bronchitis often cough up thickened mucus, which can be discolored.
        Bronchitis may be either acute or chronic.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Bronchiolitis</b> is a common lung infection in young children and
        infants. It causes inflammation and congestion in the small airways
        (bronchioles) of the lung. Bronchiolitis is almost always caused by a
        virus. Typically, the peak time for bronchiolitis is during the winter
        months.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bronchiolitis starts out with symptoms similar to those of a common
        cold, but then progresses to coughing, wheezing, and sometimes
        difficulty breathing. Symptoms of bronchiolitis can last for several
        days to weeks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most children get better with care at home. A small percentage of
        children require hospitalization.
      </p>

      <p><b>Symptoms of bronchitis and bronchiolitis</b></p>

      <p>
        Bronchitis and bronchiolitis share common symptoms like coughing,
        wheezing, and slight fever. There are other symptoms unique to each.
      </p>

      <p><b>Bronchitis symptoms</b></p>

      <p>Symptoms of bronchitis include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Cough</li>
        <li>Production of mucus</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath</li>
        <li>Slight fever</li>
        <li>Chills</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Chest discomfort or tightness</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You should make an appointment to see your doctor if your child's cough
        lasts more than three weeks or prevents them from sleeping. You should
        also call your doctor if the cough is accompanied by:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Wheezing</li>
        <li>
          Bright yellow or green mucus (this is a common symptom and indicates
          infection)
        </li>
        <li>Blood-tinged sputum</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Bronchiolitis symptoms</b></p>

      <p>Symptoms of bronchiolitis include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Dry, raspy cough</li>
        <li>Wheezing</li>
        <li>Difficulty feeding, especially in infants</li>
        <li>Slight fever</li>
        <li>Runny or stuffy nose</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If your child has any of the following symptoms, call your pediatrician
        for next steps:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>They are having difficulty breathing.</li>
        <li>They have a breathing rate of 50-60 breaths per minute.</li>
        <li>They have a temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher.</li>
        <li>They are uncharacteristically tired or irritable.</li>
        <li>They haven’t needed a diaper change in 12 hours or more.</li>
        <li>
          They’ve eaten less than half their typical amount during the last
          several meals.
        </li>
        <li>They develop a bluish color to the face.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Causes</b></p>

      <p>Both conditions can be caused by viruses.</p>

      <p>
        Acute bronchitis is often caused by viruses, especially the flu and the
        common cold.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most common cause of chronic bronchitis is smoking cigarettes or
        being around lung irritants.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Bronchiolitis</b> is typically caused by a viral infection. The
        respiratory syncytial virus causes more than half of all cases of
        bronchiolitis. The common cold or the flu can also cause the condition.
        Bronchitis can also be bacterial.
      </p>

      <p><b>Risk factors</b></p>

      <p>
        Being around cigarette smoke and other lung irritants is a risk factor
        for both conditions.
      </p>

      <p>Risk factors specific to bronchitis include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Gastric reflux, which can irritate your throat</li>
        <li>Regular exposure to irritants</li>
        <li>
          Low immune resistance, especially after a virus or primary infection
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>High risk factors for developing bronchiolitis include:</b></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Babies born prematurely</li>
        <li>Babies with heart, lung, or immune conditions</li>
        <li>Children who spend time in day care</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Diagnosis</b></p>

      <p>
        When your doctor suspects bronchitis, they will listen to the lungs with
        a stethoscope and ask about other symptoms.
      </p>

      <p>
        If your doctor suspects pneumonia, they may order a chest X-ray. Chest
        X-rays can also rule out other conditions, like lung cancer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your doctor may also order sputum tests to send to the lab for a
        culture.
      </p>

      <p>
        You may need to take a pulmonary function test. This test measures how
        well your lungs work and how well you can breathe.
      </p>

      <p>
        If your doctor suspects that your child has bronchiolitis, they will
        listen to the lungs with a stethoscope. They'll ask you about your
        child's medical history and any other symptoms. They may also:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Collect a mucus sample from your child to check for viruses associated
          with bronchiolitis
        </li>
        <li>
          Run a blood test to check your child’s white blood cell count – if
          elevated, they’ll know your child is likely fighting an infection
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Chest X-rays are almost always used in diagnosing bronchiolitis unless a
        complication is suspected.
      </p>

      <p><b>Treatment</b></p>

      <p>Treatments for bronchitis and bronchiolitis look very different.</p>

      <p><b>Treatment for bronchitis can include:</b></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Antibiotics to treat bacterial infections</li>
        <li>Cough medicine, only for use at night to aid sleeping</li>
        <li>
          Medications such as steroids that can reduce inflammation for other
          conditions like asthma
        </li>
        <li>Medications by inhalation to help open up the airways</li>
        <li>
          Pulmonary rehabilitation for chronic bronchitis, which includes a
          breathing exercise program
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Treatment for bronchiolitis can include:</b></p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Helping your baby sleep with their head slightly raised by putting a
          pillow under their mattress
        </li>
        <li>Encouraging your child to drink as much fluid as possible</li>
        <li>
          Providing supplemental oxygen or IV fluids if your child is
          hospitalized
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>The outlook for bronchiolitis vs. bronchitis</b></p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Bronchitis typically isn’t a cause for concern. But it can lead to
          complications like pneumonia. Recurrent cases could indicate that you
          have some form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which
          requires prompt treatment.
        </li>
        <li>
          Many cases of bronchiolitis are minor and easily treatable. They can
          be no more severe than a common cold. But if severe bronchiolitis
          isn’t treated, it can cause recurrent wheezing and a reduced quality
          of life. These complications can last into the teenage years. The
          condition can also be fatal if severe cases aren't treated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Most children recover at home within three to five days. If
          hospitalized, many children go home within five days, though some may
          stay for up to a week.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Can bronchiolitis and bronchitis be prevented?</b></p>

      <p>To prevent both conditions:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Avoid cigarette smoke (including second-hand cigarette smoke) and any
          other environmental irritants.
        </li>
        <li>
          Practice good hygiene, which can help reduce the risk of infections.
        </li>
        <li>
          Wash your hands regularly and encourage both visitors and children to
          do the same.
        </li>
        <li>Wipe down your children’s toys regularly.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For bronchitis prevention, you can get vaccinated with the flu vaccine
        every year. A post-flu infection can cause many cases of bronchitis.
