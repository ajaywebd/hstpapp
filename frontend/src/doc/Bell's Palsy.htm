      <h1>Bell's Palsy</h1>

      <p>
        Bell's palsy is an unexplained episode of facial muscle weakness or
        facial paralysis that begins suddenly and worsens over three to five
        days. This condition results from damage to the 7th (facial) cranial
        nerve, and pain and discomfort usually occur on one side of the face or
        head.
      </p>

      <p>
        It can strike anyone at any age, but it occurs most often in pregnant
        women, and people who have diabetes, influenza, a cold, or another upper
        respiratory ailment. According to the National Institute of Neurological
        Disorders and Stroke, this facial nerve disorder affects about 40,000
        U.S. adults and children each year. Bell's palsy strikes men and women
        equally. It is less common before age 15 or after age 60.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bell's palsy is not considered permanent, but in rare cases, it does not
        disappear. Currently, there is no known cure for Bell's palsy; however,
        recovery usually begins two weeks to six months from the onset of the
        symptoms. The majority of people with Bell's palsy recover full facial
        strength and expression.
      </p>

      <h2>Causes</h2>

      <p>
        A specific cause of Bell's palsy is unknown; however, it has been
        suggested that the disorder is due to inflammation that is directed by
        the body's immune system against the nerve controlling movement of the
        face. The weakness or symptoms seen in Bell's palsy are sometimes
        associated with the following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Diabetes</li>
        <li>High blood pressure</li>
        <li>Trauma</li>
        <li>Toxins</li>
        <li>Lyme disease</li>
        <li>Guillain-Barré syndrome</li>
        <li>Sarcoidosis</li>
        <li>Myasthenia gravis</li>
        <li>
          Infection, especially following a viral infection with Herpes simplex
          virus (a virus related to the cause of common "cold sores" of the
          mouth).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Pathogenesis</h2>

      <p>
        Idiopathic, congenital, traumatic, and neoplastic causes can all account
        for facial nerve palsy. Nearly half of these cases qualify as Bell's
        palsy and are believed to be a post-infectious, allergic, or immune
        neuritis affecting the facial nerve. Commonly associated viral illnesses
        include EBV, Mumps, and Herpesvirus. Bell's palsy is also a common
        neurologic manifestation of Lyme disease.
      </p>

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>

      <p>
        The following are the most common symptoms of Bell's palsy. However,
        each individual may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may
        include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Disordered movement of the muscles that control facial expressions,
          such as smiling, squinting, blinking, or closing the eyelid
        </li>
        <li>Loss of feeling in the face</li>
        <li>Headache</li>
        <li>Tearing</li>
        <li>Drooling</li>
        <li>
          Loss of the sense of taste on the front two-thirds of the tongue
        </li>
        <li>Hypersensitivity to sound in the affected ear</li>
        <li>Inability to close the eye on the affected side of the face</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Clinical Manifestations</h2>

      <p>
        Physical manifestations may go unnoticed by parents and may have a
        sudden onset (within a period of hours).
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Weakness of upper and lower face (forehead muscle sparing is
          suggestive of upper motor neuron lesion due to bilateral innervation)
        </li>
        <li>Inability to close the eye</li>
        <li>
          Unilateral drooping of the corner of the mouth, which may become
          evident when the child smiles
        </li>
        <li>Loss of nasolabial fold</li>
        <li>Normal sensation</li>
        <li>Loss of taste in the anterior two-thirds of the tongue</li>
        <li>
          Initial presentation may include pain around the ear or surrounding
          areas
        </li>
        <li>May be associated with hyperacusis</li>
        <li>Prodrome of ear pain and dysacusis may be present</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Differential Diagnosis of Facial Weakness</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Otitis media</li>
        <li>Mastoiditis</li>
        <li>Temporal bone abscess</li>
        <li>Trauma</li>
        <li>Iatrogenic surgical injury</li>
        <li>Intracranial lesions including tumors, AVMs, infarcts</li>
        <li>Nerve tumors</li>
        <li>Leukemic invasion of the facial nerve, rhabdomyosarcomas</li>
        <li>Polio in endemic areas</li>
        <li>Hypertension</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Course</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          85% have complete recovery from weeks to months after onset. 10% have
          mild residual weakness and about 5% have severe residual facial
          weakness. Incomplete recovery is associated with total facial
          involvement. These patients should have electrophysiologic testing and
          other etiologies should be considered.
        </li>
        <li>There is about a 7% recurrence rate.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>

      <p>
        One uniformly recommended treatment for Bell's palsy is protecting the
        eye from drying at nighttime or while working at a computer. Eye care,
        which may include eye drops during the day, ointment at bedtime, or a
        moisture chamber at night, helps protect the cornea from scratching,
        which is crucial to the management of Bell’s palsy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your doctor will establish an appropriate treatment protocol for your
        condition based on the severity of your symptoms and your medical
        profile. Other treatment options include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Steroid medications to reduce inflammation</li>
        <li>Antiviral medications, such as acyclovir</li>
        <li>Analgesics or moist heat to relieve pain</li>
        <li>Physical therapy to stimulate the facial nerve</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Alternative Therapies</h2>

      <p>
        Some individuals may choose to use alternative therapies in the
        treatment of Bell's palsy, but there is no proof that these therapies
        make a significant difference in a person's recovery. Such treatments
        may include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Relaxation</li>
        <li>Acupuncture</li>
        <li>Electrical stimulation</li>
        <li>Biofeedback training</li>
        <li>Vitamin therapy, including B12, B6, and Zinc</li>
      </ul>
