      <h1><b>Cold Sores</b></h1>

      <p>
        For adults, cold sores are uncomfortable and embarrassing, but for
        newborn babies, the virus that causes them can be downright dangerous.
        The blisters, which appear on the edge of your lip, can be spread
        between anyone who comes into contact with an open sore, including
        babies and children.
      </p>

      <p>
        Read on to learn how babies can get cold sores and what you can do to
        keep them from getting exposed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cold sores are tiny fluid-filled blisters that form in a cluster, often
        at the edge of your lip. Before you notice the blisters, you may feel
        tingling, itching, or burning in the area. After a few days, the
        blisters will pop, form a crust, and go away in about one to two weeks.
      </p>

      <p><b>Symptoms</b></p>

      <p>
        You may notice a tingling or burning sensation on your lips or face
        several days before a cold sore develops. This is the best time to start
        treatment. Once the sore forms, you'll see a raised, red blister full of
        fluid. It will usually be painful and tender to the touch. There may be
        more than one sore present.
      </p>

      <p>
        The cold sore will remain for up to two weeks and will be contagious
        until it crusts over. Your first cold sore may not appear for up to 20
        days after you contract the herpes simplex virus.
      </p>

      <p>
        You may also experience one or more of the following symptoms during an
        outbreak:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>fever</li>
        <li>muscle aches</li>
        <li>swollen lymph nodes</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You should call your doctor immediately if you develop any eye symptoms
        during a cold sore outbreak. Infections caused by the herpes simplex
        virus can lead to permanent vision loss when they’re not treated
        promptly.
      </p>

      <p><b>Stages of a cold sore</b></p>

      <p>A cold sore goes through five stages:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Stage one:</b> Tingling and itching occur about 24 hours before
          blisters erupt.
        </li>
        <li><b>Stage two:</b> Fluid-filled blisters appear.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Stage three:</b> The blisters burst, ooze, and form painful sores.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Stage four:</b> The sores dry out and scab over, causing itching
          and cracking.
        </li>
        <li><b>Stage five:</b> The scab falls off and the cold sore heals.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Causes</b></p>

      <p>
        A cold sore is actually the result of a virus called the herpes simplex
        virus (HSV). There are two strains of the virus, HSV-1 and HSV-2.
        Typically, HSV-1 causes cold sores on the mouth, while HSV-2 causes
        sores on the genitals. However, both strains can cause sores on the
        mouth and genitals as well as other areas of the body, if you’re exposed
        to them.
      </p>

      <p><b>How Is It Spread?</b></p>

      <p>
        The herpes virus is very contagious and is easily spread by skin-to-skin
        contact. Adults often get herpes from activities like kissing or oral
        sex or by sharing razors or towels. A person who has the virus can
        spread it even when they’re not having symptoms, but they’re more
        contagious during an outbreak when a cold sore is visible.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not everyone who carries HSV-1 or HSV-2 gets cold sores or genital
        outbreaks regularly. You may only get one after your initial infection,
        but the virus still remains inactive and hidden in your body forever.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other people experience regular outbreaks that may be triggered by
        stress or changes in the body.
      </p>

      <p>Some common triggers are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>illness or fever</li>
        <li>stress</li>
        <li>menstruation</li>
        <li>pregnancy</li>
        <li>sun exposure</li>
        <li>injury</li>
        <li>fatigue</li>
        <li>immune system deficiencies</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If a woman is pregnant, it’s possible for her to spread the virus to the
        baby during pregnancy and childbirth. Dr. Timothy Spence, an
        Austin-based pediatrician, says, “Most cases are transmitted during
        labor when the mother has active [genital sores].”
      </p>

      <p>
        He advises pregnant women with a history of herpes to tell their doctor.
        “If there are active [genital sores] at the time of delivery, they will
        likely do a cesarean section,” says Dr. Spence.
      </p>

      <p><b>Risk factors</b></p>

      <p>
        Dr. Spence says infants in the first three to four weeks of life are at
        the highest risk for having severe symptoms from catching the herpes
        virus. It can cause infection in the brain, leading to seizures, fever,
        irritability, poor feeding, and very low energy. It usually does not
        present just as a cold sore.
      </p>

      <p>
        About 1 in every 3,500 babies born in the United States gets neonatal
        herpes, and the symptoms almost always show up during the baby’s first
        month after birth. Neonatal herpes is much more dangerous than when
        herpes occurs in older children. A baby with neonatal herpes may get
        very ill. In severe cases, the infection can affect the skin, liver,
        brain, lungs, and kidneys, and even be life-threatening.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fortunately, herpes infections are not usually so dangerous once the
        baby is a few months old.
      </p>

      <p>
        "An older infant who comes in contact with a cold sore is going to have
        similar [sores] you’d see on an adult," says Dr. Spence. "Herpes in
        childhood is quite common." However, the first time someone has an
        outbreak of herpes (primary herpes), symptoms are usually more severe.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to mouth sores, older babies and children may develop
        blisters on the tongue, back of the throat, and inside of the cheeks.
        These can be painful and make the child irritable, but will eventually
        go away. Soothing them with cold treats, like popsicles, and
        acetaminophen (children’s Tylenol) can help ease the discomfort.
      </p>

      <p>
        The virus can also spread to the eyes if the baby touches an open sore
        and then rubs their eyes. Tell your doctor right away if you notice any
        blisters near the baby’s eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bottom line, Dr. Spence says, is: “If the baby has been in contact
        with someone who has a cold sore and the baby has a fever, you should
        tell your doctor.” You should also let your doctor know right away if
        you see any blisters near the baby’s eyes.
      </p>

      <p><b>Treatment</b></p>

      <p>
        In adults and children, cold sores will go away without treatment in
        about one to two weeks. There are some ways to speed up the healing
        process.
      </p>

      <p>
        Babies at risk for complications are given anti-viral treatment, often
        at the hospital.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re looking to shorten an outbreak and reduce the chance of
        spreading the virus, your doctor can prescribe anti-viral medications to
        take by mouth or apply as a cream or ointment. There are also some
        available in drugstores over the counter. Medications taken by mouth
        help to shorten the outbreak time, and creams and ointments help reduce
        symptoms.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have a genital outbreak during pregnancy, your doctor may
        prescribe medication.
      </p>

      <p>Pill forms include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>acyclovir (Xerese, Zovirax)</li>
        <li>valacyclovir (Valtrex)</li>
        <li>famciclovir (Famvir)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Ointments include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>penciclovir (Denavir)</li>
        <li>docosanol (Abreva)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Other at-home treatments include using a cold compress, taking a pain
        reliever like acetaminophen (Tylenol), keeping lips protected from the
        sun, and applying an over-the-counter cream with lidocaine or benzocaine
        for pain relief.
      </p>

      <p><b>Protect your child</b></p>

      <p>
        “If a mom has a cold sore she doesn’t need to isolate herself from the
        baby, but she does need to do everything she can to limit the baby’s
        exposure to the cold sore. Keeping it covered, no kissing, and
        hand-washing. Once [the sore] is scabbed over, it’s no longer
        contagious,” says Dr. Spence. A cold sore is considered mostly healed
        once it is scabbed and dry, though you cannot know for sure when you are
        not contagious.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here are some ways to keep your baby from being exposed to a cold sore:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Use separate eating utensils, towels, or washcloths only for the baby.
        </li>
        <li>
          Wash hands thoroughly immediately after touching a cold sore and
          before touching your baby.
        </li>
        <li>
          Teach children with cold sores not to rub their eyes or kiss anyone
          while they have a sore.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tell all adults handling the baby to avoid kissing if they have a cold
          sore.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Complications</b></p>

      <p>
        The initial infection of herpes simplex can cause more severe symptoms
        and complications, as your body hasn’t built up a defense to the virus
        yet. Complications are rare, but they can occur, especially in young
        children. Call your doctor immediately if you’re experiencing any of the
        following symptoms:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>high or persistent fever</li>
        <li>difficulty breathing or swallowing</li>
        <li>red, irritated eyes with or without discharge</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Complications are more likely to occur in people who have eczema or a
        condition that weakens their immune system, such as cancer or AIDS. If
        you do have any of these conditions, contact your doctor if you think
        you’ve contracted the herpes simplex virus.
