      <h1>Cerebral Palsy</h1>

      <p>
        Cerebral palsy (CP) is a brain (neurological) disorder that causes
        problems with normal motor function. It is a lifelong condition that
        affects how the brain and muscles communicate. CP affects body movement,
        muscle control, coordination, reflexes, posture, and balance. These
        problems are caused by damage to or abnormal development of certain
        brain areas. But many children with cerebral palsy have normal
        intelligence. CP can range in severity, but it does not get worse over
        time. CP does not get better over time either. With diagnosis and
        treatment, children can learn how to manage their condition.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of cerebral palsy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Spastic cerebral palsy- causes stiffness and movement difficulties
        </li>
        <li>
          Dyskinetic (athetoid) cerebral palsy- leads to involuntary and
          uncontrolled movements
        </li>
        <li>
          Ataxic cerebral palsy- causes a problem with balance and depth
          perception
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Causes</h2>
      <p>
        CP occurs when there is abnormal development of or damage to areas of
        the brain that control motor function. This can happen before or during
        birth (congenital CP). Most of CP is congenital. Less commonly, CP can
        happen after birth. This is called acquired CP and usually happens from
        an infection or head injury.
      </p>
      <p>
        In many cases, the exact cause of CP is not known. It may be the result
        of a problem such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lack of oxygen to the brain</li>
        <li>Genetic condition</li>
        <li>Infection</li>
        <li>Bleeding in the brain</li>
        <li>Severe jaundice</li>
        <li>Head injury</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Children at Risk</h2>
      <p>A child is more at risk for CP because of any of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Preterm birth</li>
        <li>
          Inflammation of the placenta or amniotic fluid from an infection
          (chorioamnionitis)
        </li>
        <li>Blood clotting disorder</li>
        <li>Very low birthweight, especially under 3.3 pounds</li>
        <li>Infection with a virus</li>
        <li>Chemical or substance abuse during pregnancy</li>
        <li>Bleeding in the brain</li>
        <li>Injury</li>
        <li>Complications of labor and delivery, in rare cases</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>
      <p>
        The following are the most common symptoms of CP. However, each child
        may experience symptoms differently. The child may have muscle weakness,
        poor motor control, or have shaking, also called spasticity, of the arms
        or legs. Muscle stiffness in the form of stiff legs or clenched fists
        may also be seen. Cerebral palsy is classified according to the kind of
        motor function the child may have, including the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Spastic diplegia (di means two): Spastic movements of the arms or
          legs. Diplegia is also called paraplegia.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spastic quadriplegia (quad means four): Spastic movements in all four
          limbs (arms and legs).
        </li>
        <li>
          Spastic hemiplegia (hemi means half): Spasticity affecting one half,
          or side, of the body (such as the right arm and right leg).
        </li>
        <li>
          Spastic double hemiplegia: Spasticity in both sides of the body, but
          the amount of shaking is different when comparing the right side to
          the left side.
        </li>
        <li>
          Athetoid (or dyskinetic): Involuntary (unable to control),
          purposeless, and rigid movement.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ataxic: Affects balance, leading to an unsteady gait, and motions,
          which require fine coordination, such as writing.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Additional Problems</h2>
      <p>
        Children with CP may have additional problems, including the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Seizures</li>
        <li>Vision, hearing, or speech problems</li>
        <li>Learning disabilities and behavior problems</li>
        <li>Bowel and bladder problems</li>
        <li>
          Bone abnormalities including scoliosis (a lateral, or sideways,
          curvature and rotation of the back bones, giving the appearance that
          the person is leaning to one side)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
      <p>
        The diagnosis of CP is made with a physical examination. During the
        examination, the doctor obtains a complete prenatal and birth history of
        the child. The diagnosis of CP is not usually made until the child is at
        least 6 to 12 months old. This is the time when the child should be
        achieving developmental milestones, such as walking, and hand and head
        control. However, approximately half of the children suspected to have
        CP at 12 months appear to grow out of it by age 2.
      </p>
      <p>Diagnostic tests may include the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Neurological examination</li>
        <li>X-rays</li>
        <li>Feeding studies</li>
        <li>Electroencephalogram (EEG)</li>
        <li>Blood tests</li>
        <li>Gait lab analysis</li>
        <li>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</li>
        <li>Computed tomography scan (also called CAT or CT scan)</li>
        <li>Genetic studies</li>
        <li>Metabolic tests</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
      <p>
        Specific treatment for cerebral palsy will be determined by your child's
        doctor based on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your child's age, overall health, and medical history</li>
        <li>The extent of the disease</li>
        <li>The type of CP</li>
        <li>
          Your child's tolerance for specific medications, procedures, or
          therapies
        </li>
        <li>Expectations for the course of the disease</li>
        <li>Your opinion or preference</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Associated Problems :</h2>

      <h4>Intellectual Disability</h4>
      <p>
        It has been estimated that more than half of children with cerebral
        palsy have problems with intellectual functioning (thinking,
        problem-solving). Many are classified as having intellectual
        disabilities, while others have average abilities with some learning
        disorders. Some have perfectly normal intelligence.
      </p>

      <h4>Seizures</h4>
      <p>
        One out of every three people with cerebral palsy has or will develop
        seizures. Fortunately, these seizures usually can be controlled with
        anticonvulsant medications.
      </p>

      <h4>Vision Difficulties</h4>
      <p>
        Because the injury to the brain often affects eye muscle coordination,
        more than three out of four children with cerebral palsy have
        strabismus, a problem with one eye turning in or out. If this problem is
        not corrected early, the vision in the affected eye will get worse and
        eventually will be lost permanently. Thus, it is extremely important to
        have your childâ€™s eyes checked regularly by your pediatrician.
      </p>

      <h4>Limb Shortening and Scoliosis</h4>
      <p>
        Of those children with cerebral palsy affecting only one side of the
        body, over half will develop a shortening of the involved leg and arm.
        The difference between the legs is rarely more than two inches (5 cm),
        but an orthopedic surgeon should be consulted if shortening is noticed.
        A heel or sole lift may be prescribed to fit into the shoe on the
        shorter side to prevent a tilt of the pelvis, which can lead to
        scoliosis.
      </p>

      <h4>Dental Problems</h4>
      <p>
        Many children with cerebral palsy have a greater risk of developing oral
        diseases from poor oral hygiene, leading to gingivitis and cavities.
        Some medications, such as seizure or asthma drugs, may also contribute
        to cavities.
      </p>

      <h4>Hearing Loss</h4>
      <p>
        Some children with cerebral palsy have a complete or partial hearing
        loss, which may result from severe jaundice or oxygen deficiency at
        birth. If you notice signs like lack of response to loud noises, consult
        your pediatrician.
      </p>

      <h4>Joint Problems</h4>
      <p>
        In children with spastic forms of cerebral palsy, extreme stiffening of
        the joints, known as contracture, can occur. Physical therapy, braces,
        casting, or medication may be used to improve joint mobility and
        stability.
      </p>

      <h4>Problems with Spatial Awareness</h4>
      <p>
        Over half of the children with cerebral palsy affecting one side of the
        body cannot sense the position of their limbs on the affected side.
        Physical or occupational therapy can help them learn to use the affected
        parts of their body.
      </p>

      <h2>Long-term Outlook</h2>
      <p>
        Since CP is a lifelong condition that is not correctable, management
        focuses on preventing or minimizing deformities and maximizing the
        child's capabilities at home and in the community. Positive
        reinforcement will encourage the child to strengthen self-esteem and
        promote as much independence as possible.
