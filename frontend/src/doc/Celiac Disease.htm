      <h1><b>Celiac Disease</b></h1>

      <p>
        Celiac disease is a digestive problem that hurts your small intestine.
        It stops your body from taking in nutrients from food. People with
        celiac disease are sensitive to gluten. Gluten is a kind of protein
        found in wheat, rye, barley, and sometimes in small amounts in mixed
        oats. If your child has celiac disease, consuming gluten will cause
        damage to finger-like projections, called villi, in the lining of your
        child's small intestines.
      </p>

      <p>
        Celiac disease is a life-long condition, but it is manageable through
        permanent modifications to the diet. Simply put, anyone with celiac
        disease must adhere to a gluten-free diet. While this may seem daunting
        at first—especially for kids—you'll find that many nutritious, tasty
        foods fit into this diet (including fruits and vegetables, eggs, meat,
        poultry—and even soft drinks and ice cream!).
      </p>

      <p>For more information and ideas, see CDHNF's Gluten-Free Diet Guide.</p>

      <p><b>Quick Facts on Celiac Disease:</b></p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Approximately 40,000 Americans have been diagnosed with celiac
          disease.
        </li>
        <li>
          Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease, meaning it causes a person's
          immune system to attack the body.
        </li>
        <li>
          Symptoms of celiac disease can appear at any age after gluten is
          introduced into the diet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Patients with celiac disease must follow a lifelong gluten-free diet.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Children are at higher risk for celiac disease if they have:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Type 1 diabetes</li>
        <li>Autoimmune thyroid disease</li>
        <li>Dermatitis herpetiformis</li>
        <li>Down syndrome</li>
        <li>Turner syndrome</li>
        <li>Williams syndrome</li>
        <li>A relative with celiac disease</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Does My Child Have Celiac Disease?</b></p>

      <p>
        A child can begin to show symptoms of celiac disease any time after they
        begin to eat foods with gluten. Symptoms vary from child to child, with
        some children showing no symptoms at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the time a child does develop symptoms, some damage to the small
        intestine has already occurred. Therefore, if you think your child may
        have celiac disease, contact your pediatrician immediately.
      </p>

      <p><b>What Causes Celiac Disease?</b></p>

      <p>
        Celiac disease is a genetic disease that runs in families. You may have
        celiac disease and not know it because you don’t have any symptoms.
      </p>

      <p>Some things that may make symptoms start to appear are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Too much stress</li>
        <li>Pregnancy or childbirth</li>
        <li>Surgery</li>
        <li>Physical injury</li>
        <li>Infection</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Celiac Disease Symptoms May Include:</b></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Chronic diarrhea or (more rarely) constipation</li>
        <li>Vomiting</li>
        <li>Bloating and gas</li>
        <li>Irritability</li>
        <li>Decreased appetite and/or poor weight gain</li>
        <li>Growth and pubertal delay</li>
        <li>Iron deficiency anemia</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Fractures or thin bones</li>
        <li>Decreased muscle mass in the limbs</li>
        <li>Damage to tooth enamel or failure of enamel formation</li>
        <li>A chronic itchy rash called dermatitis herpetiformis</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Diagnosing Celiac Disease</b></p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Blood work:</b> If your pediatrician suspects that your child has
          celiac disease, they may start by having the child’s blood tested. Two
          tests—the anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTG) and the
          anti-endomysial antibody (EMA) tests—are highly accurate and reliable
          in determining the likelihood of celiac disease.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Biopsy:</b> To confirm a celiac disease diagnosis, a tissue sample
          from the small intestine is inspected for changes to the villi,
          obtained through a procedure called an endoscopy with biopsy.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Treatment and Management</b></p>

      <p>
        If your child has been diagnosed with celiac disease, here’s the good
        news: it’s a highly manageable condition. Once gluten is removed from
        your child's diet, you can expect to see improvement within one or two
        weeks. Within six to 12 months on the gluten-free diet, the lining of
        the intestine will heal, and your child's growth and bone strength will
        return to normal.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your child will have to adhere to a gluten-free diet for life. Foods
        like bread, cereal, cakes, pizza, and anything containing wheat, barley,
        or rye are off-limits.
      </p>

      <p><b>Living with Celiac Disease</b></p>

      <p>
        Celiac disease is a chronic disease, and patients need to adjust their
        lifestyle significantly. It can have a social and emotional impact,
        causing isolation or anxiety about food-related events. Seeking support
        groups or counseling may help.
      </p>

      <p><b>What is Gluten?</b></p>

      <p>
        Gluten is the general name for one of the proteins found in wheat, rye,
        and barley. It is the substance in flour that forms the structure of
        dough, the “glue” that holds the product together and is also the
        leavening ingredient. When these proteins are present in the diet of
        someone with CD, they become toxic and cause damage to the intestine.
        This damage leads to decreased absorption of essential nutrients and, if
        left untreated, can lead to nutrient deficiency and subsequent disease
        (i.e. iron deficiency anemia, decreased bone density, unintentional
        weight loss, folate and vitamin B12 deficiency).
      </p>

      <p><b>Where is Gluten Found?</b></p>

      <p>
        <b>Food/grains :</b>
        Gluten is found in wheat, rye, barley, and all their derivatives. These
        grains are used in breads, cereals, pasta, pizza, cakes, pies, cookies,
        and many processed food items.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>What About Oats?</b>
        Many recent studies indicate that oats may not be harmful to most people
        with celiac disease. However, oats may be contaminated with wheat during
        processing, so consult your physician or dietitian before adding oats to
        the diet.
