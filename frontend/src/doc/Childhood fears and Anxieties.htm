      <h1>Understanding Childhood Fears and Anxieties</h1>

      <p>
        From time to time, every child experiences fear. As youngsters explore
        the world around them, having new experiences and confronting new
        challenges, anxieties are almost an unavoidable part of growing up.
      </p>

      <h2>Fears are Common:</h2>
      <p>
        According to one study, 43% of children between ages 6 and 12 had many
        fears and concerns. A fear of darkness, particularly being left alone in
        the dark, is one of the most common fears in this age group. So is a
        fear of animals, such as large barking dogs. Some children are afraid of
        fires, high places, or thunderstorms. Others, conscious of news reports
        on TV and in the newspapers, are concerned about burglars, kidnappers,
        or nuclear war. If there has been a recent serious illness or death in
        the family, they may become anxious about the health of those around
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        In middle childhood, fears wax and wane. Most are mild, but even when
        they intensify, they generally subside on their own after a while.
      </p>

      <h2>About Phobias:</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes fears can become so extreme, persistent, and focused that they
        develop into phobias. Phobias, which are strong and irrational fears,
        can become persistent and debilitating, significantly influencing and
        interfering with a child's usual daily activities. For instance, a
        6-year-old's phobia about dogs might make him so panicky that he refuses
        to go outdoors at all because there could be a dog there. A 10-year-old
        child might become so terrified about news reports of a serial killer
        that he insists on sleeping with his parents at night.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some children in this age group develop phobias about the people they
        meet in their everyday lives. This severe shyness can keep them from
        making friends at school and relating to most adults, especially
        strangers. They might consciously avoid social situations like birthday
        parties or Scout meetings, and they often find it difficult to converse
        comfortably with anyone except their immediate family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Separation anxiety is also common in this age group. Sometimes this fear
        can intensify when the family moves to a new neighborhood or children
        are placed in a childcare setting where they feel uncomfortable. These
        youngsters might become afraid of going to summer camp or even attending
        school. Their phobias can cause physical symptoms like headaches or
        stomach pains and eventually lead the children to withdraw into their
        own world, becoming clinically depressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        At about age 6 or 7, as children develop an understanding about death,
        another fear can arise. With the recognition that death will eventually
        affect everyone, and that it is permanent and irreversible, the normal
        worry about the possible death of family members—or even their own
        death—can intensify. In some cases, this preoccupation with death can
        become disabling.
      </p>

      <h2>Treating Fears & Phobias:</h2>
      <p>
        Fortunately, most phobias are quite treatable. In general, they are not
        a sign of serious mental illness requiring many months or years of
        therapy. However, if your child's anxieties persist and interfere with
        her enjoyment of day-to-day life, she might benefit from some
        professional help from a psychiatrist or psychologist who specializes in
        treating phobias.
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of the treatment plan for phobias, many therapists suggest
        exposing your child to the source of her anxiety in small,
        nonthreatening doses. Under a therapist's guidance, a child who is
        afraid of dogs might begin by talking about this fear and by looking at
        photographs or a videotape of dogs. Next, she might observe a live dog
        from behind the safety of a window. Then, with a parent or a therapist
        at her side, she might spend a few minutes in the same room with a
        friendly, gentle puppy. Eventually, she will find herself able to pet
        the dog, then expose herself to situations with larger, unfamiliar dogs.
      </p>
      <p>
        This gradual process is called desensitization, meaning that your child
        will become a little less sensitive to the source of her fear each time
        she confronts it. Ultimately, the child will no longer feel the need to
        avoid the situation that has been the basis of her phobia. While this
        process sounds like common sense and easy to carry out, it should be
        done only under the supervision of a professional.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes psychotherapy can also help children become more self-assured
        and less fearful. Breathing and relaxation exercises can assist
        youngsters in stressful circumstances too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Occasionally, your doctor may recommend medications as a component of
        the treatment program, although never as the sole therapeutic tool.
        These drugs may include antidepressants, which are designed to ease the
        anxiety and panic that often underlie these problems.
      </p>

      <h2>What Parents Can Do:</h2>
      <p>
        Here are some suggestions that many parents find useful for their
        children with fears and phobias:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Talk with your child about his anxieties, and be sympathetic. Explain
          to him that many children have fears, but with your support he can
          learn to put them behind him.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not belittle or ridicule your child's fears, particularly in front
          of his peers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not try to coerce your youngster into being brave. It will take
          time for him to confront and gradually overcome his anxieties. You
          can, however, encourage (but not force) him to progressively come
          face-to-face with whatever he fears.
        </li>
        <li>
          Since fears are a normal part of life and often are a response to a
          real or at least perceived threat in the child's environment, parents
          should be reassuring and supportive. Talking with their children,
          parents should acknowledge, though not increase or reinforce, their
          children's concerns. Point out what is already being done to protect
          the child, and involve the child in identifying additional steps that
          could be taken. Such simple, sensitive, and straightforward parenting
          can resolve or at least manage most childhood fears. When realistic
          reassurances are not successful, the child's fear may be a phobia.
        </li>
