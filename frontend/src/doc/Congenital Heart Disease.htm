      <h1>Congenital Heart Disease</h1>

      <p>
        Congenital (meaning present at birth) heart disease is a term used to
        describe a number of different conditions that affect the heart. These
        heart abnormalities are problems that occur as the baby's heart is
        developing during pregnancy, before the baby is born. Congenital heart
        disease (CHD) affects 1 in 120 babies born in the United States, making
        heart defects the most common birth defects.
      </p>

      <p>
        Specific steps must take place in order for the heart to form correctly.
        Often, congenital heart disease is a result of one of these crucial
        steps not happening at the right time.
      </p>

      <p>
        We can classify the different types of congenital heart disease into
        several categories in order to better understand the problems your baby
        may experience.
      </p>

      <h2>They include:</h2>

      <h3>Problems that cause too much blood to pass through the lungs</h3>

      <p>
        These defects allow oxygen-rich blood that should be traveling to the
        body to re-circulate through the lungs, causing increased pressure and
        stress in the lungs. They include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA):</b> This defect short circuits the
          normal pulmonary vascular system and allows blood to mix between the
          pulmonary artery and the aorta. Prior to birth, there is an open
          passageway between the two blood vessels. This opening closes soon
          after birth. When it does not close, some blood returns to the lungs.
          Patent ductus arteriosus is often seen in premature infants.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Atrial septal defect (ASD):</b> In this condition, there is an
          abnormal opening between the two upper chambers of the heart – the
          right and left atria – causing an abnormal blood flow through the
          heart.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Ventricular septal defect (VSD):</b> In this condition, a hole in
          the ventricular septum (a dividing wall between the two lower chambers
          of the heart – the right and left ventricles) occurs. Because of this
          opening, blood from the left ventricle flows back into the right
          ventricle, due to higher pressure in the left ventricle. This causes
          an extra volume of blood to be pumped into the lungs by the right
          ventricle, often creating congestion in the lungs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Atrioventricular canal (AVC or AV canal):</b> AVC is a complex
          heart problem that involves several abnormalities of structures inside
          the heart, including atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect,
          and improperly formed mitral and/or tricuspid valves.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Problems that cause too little blood to pass through the lungs</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          These conditions allow blood that has not been to the lungs to pick up
          oxygen to travel to the body. The body does not receive enough oxygen
          with these heart problems. Babies with these forms of CHD may be
          cyanotic, which means they look blue. These conditions include:
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Tricuspid atresia:</b> In this condition, there is no tricuspid
          valve, which means no blood flows from the right atrium to the right
          ventricle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Pulmonary atresia:</b> This is a complicated CHD in which there is
          abnormal development of the pulmonary valve.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Transposition of the great arteries (TGA):</b> With this condition,
          the positions of the pulmonary artery and the aorta are reversed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF):</b> This condition is characterized by
          four defects, including an abnormal opening, or ventricular septal
          defect; a narrowing (stenosis) at or just beneath the pulmonary valve
          that partially blocks the flow of blood from the right side of the
          heart to the lungs; a right ventricle that is more muscular than
          normal and often enlarged; and an aorta that lies directly over the
          ventricular septal defect.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Double outlet right ventricle (DORV):</b> In this condition, both
          the aorta and the pulmonary artery are connected to the right
          ventricle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Truncus arteriosus:</b> In this condition, the aorta and pulmonary
          artery start as a single blood vessel, which eventually divides and
          becomes two separate arteries. Truncus arteriosus occurs when the
          single great vessel fails to separate completely, leaving a connection
          between the aorta and pulmonary artery.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Problems that cause too little blood to travel to the body</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          These defects are a result of underdeveloped chambers of the heart or
          blockage in blood vessels that prevent the proper amount of blood from
          traveling to the body to meet its needs. They include:
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Coarctation of the aorta (CoA):</b> In this condition, the aorta is
          narrowed or constricted, obstructing blood flow to the lower part of
          the body and increasing blood pressure above the constriction.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Aortic stenosis (AS):</b> In this condition, the aortic valve
          between the left ventricle and the aorta did not form properly and is
          narrowed, making it difficult for the heart to pump blood to the body.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS):</b> A combination of
          several abnormalities of the heart and the great blood vessels.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In some cases, there will be a combination of several heart defects,
        making for a more complex problem that can fall into several of these
        categories.
      </p>

      <h2>Causes of congenital heart disease</h2>

      <p>
        Many congenital heart diseases have a genetic cause. Some known
        associations include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Chromosome abnormalities, such as Down syndrome, trisomy 18 and
          trisomy 13, and Turner's syndrome
        </li>
        <li>
          Microdeletion or microduplication syndromes, such as DiGeorge syndrome
        </li>
        <li>Single gene defects</li>
        <li>Environmental factors</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you have a congenital heart defect, we recommend you speak with a
        genetic counselor or genetic specialist before becoming pregnant.
      </p>

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>

      <p>
        <b
          >Symptoms of congenital heart defects in infants and children
          include:</b
        >
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Cyanosis (a bluish tint to the skin, fingernails, and lips)</li>
        <li>Respiratory distress</li>
        <li>Poor feeding</li>
        <li>Poor weight gain</li>
        <li>Recurrent lung infections</li>
        <li>
          Less ability to exercise or play actively compared to other children
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Testing and diagnosis</h2>

      <p>
        Many serious congenital heart diseases are detected during pregnancy,
        during a routine ultrasound exam. Others may be diagnosed shortly after
        birth. Less serious heart conditions may go undiagnosed until children
        are older and begin to show certain signs or symptoms of congenital
        heart disease.
      </p>

      <p>
        During pregnancy, if your physician believes your baby may have CHD, you
        will likely be referred to a pediatric cardiologist for further testing.
        The type of diagnostic tests performed will depend on the form of CHD
        your child may have. Examples of the tests used include fetal
        echocardiogram, electrocardiogram (EKG), cardiac magnetic resonance
        imaging (MRI) and cardiac catheterization.
      </p>

      <h2>Treatments for congenital heart disease</h2>

      <p>
        Congenital heart problems range from simple to complex. Some heart
        problems can be watched by your child's cardiologist and managed with
        medicines, while others will require heart surgery or cardiac
        catheterization — sometimes as soon as in the first few hours after
        birth.
      </p>

      <p>
        A child may even "grow out" of some of the simpler heart problems, such
        as patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) or atrial septal defect (ASD). These
        conditions may simply resolve on their own as the child grows. Other
        children will have more complex forms of congenital heart disease, or a
        combination of different types, and require several operations or
        catheter interventions and ongoing care throughout their lives.
      </p>

      <h2>Outlook and follow-up care</h2>

      <p>
        Babies with congenital heart disease are followed by specialists called
        pediatric cardiologists. These physicians diagnose heart conditions and
        help manage the health of children before and after surgical repair of
        the heart problem. Specialists who correct heart problems in the
        operating room are known as pediatric cardiovascular or cardiothoracic
        surgeons.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is imperative that individuals born with congenital heart disease who
        have reached adulthood transition to the appropriate type of cardiac
        care. The type of care required is based on the type of CHD a person
        has. People with simple types of CHD can generally be cared for by a
        community adult cardiologist.
