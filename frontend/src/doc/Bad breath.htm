      <h1>Bad Breath</h1>

      <p>
        Bad breath, medically known as halitosis, is a condition that even
        healthy children can sometimes experience. If you've noticed that your
        little one's breath is not so pleasant, there is hope. When it comes to
        bad breath in children, most of the time improper oral hygiene is the
        culprit.
      </p>

      <h2>Causes</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of factors that could contribute to bad breath. Here
        are some of the most common causes:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Poor oral hygiene.</strong> If your child doesn't brush and
          floss frequently, bad breath can result. If plaque is not brushed
          away, it can irritate the gums, causing additional issues. The tongue
          can also harbor bacteria that produce foul odors and bad breath, so
          make sure your child brushes their tongue as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dry mouth.</strong> Saliva helps cleanse the mouth. When your
          child's mouth produces less saliva than normal, xerostomia may occur,
          contributing to bad breath.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mouth breathing.</strong> When a child breathes through their
          mouth (due to a stuffy nose or as a sleep habit), it prevents saliva
          from washing away bacteria, which promotes bad breath.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bacteria on the tongue.</strong> Most odor-causing bacteria
          reside on the tongue. If you don't brush the tongue, odor-causing
          bacteria will accumulate and cause bad breath.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Infections in the mouth.</strong> Bad breath can also result
          from cavities, plaque buildup, mouth sores, or oral surgery.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A foreign object.</strong> Sometimes a baby or toddler will
          place a foreign object (tiny toys, food particles, etc.) in their
          nose. A foreign object lodged in the nose can cause bad breath in
          children.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Certain foods.</strong> If your child consumes foods with
          strong odors like garlic, onions, or specific spices, it can impact
          the freshness of their breath.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Medications.</strong> Sometimes, the way medication breaks
          down in the body can lead to bad breath, releasing chemicals that
          result in bad breath.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>An illness or condition.</strong> If your child suffers from
          allergies, a sinus infection, tonsillitis, or another condition, bad
          breath can occur.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Avoid Bad Breath</h2>

      <p>
        Healthy teeth are integral to a child's overall health and well-being.
        You can help your child avoid bad breath by developing an oral care
        routine:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Have your child brush twice a day with ADA-approved fluoride
          toothpaste to promote fresh breath. Always supervise young children to
          prevent them from swallowing the toothpaste.
        </li>
        <li>
          When your child brushes their teeth, make sure they also clean their
          tongue, as bacteria can collect and grow there.
        </li>
        <li>
          Floss daily to remove odor-causing food particles from between the
          teeth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Get a new toothbrush every few months, as dull bristles cannot
          effectively remove plaque and debris.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid halitosis and other oral health concerns by scheduling regular
          checkups and professional cleanings with a dentist.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Chronic Bad Breath in Children</h2>

      <p>
        Most of the time, your child's bad breath will go away with improved
        oral hygiene. However, some children may experience chronic bad breath.
        If a dentist determines that your child's mouth is healthy, you may be
        referred to a primary care physician for additional tests to diagnose
        the underlying cause of the halitosis.
      </p>

      <p>
        Regardless of the cause of bad breath, teaching children good dental
        care habits early on can play a vital role in their oral health as
        adults.
