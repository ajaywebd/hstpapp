      <h1>Asthma in Children</h1>
      <p>
        In childhood asthma, the lungs and airways become easily inflamed when
        exposed to certain triggers, such as inhaling airborne pollen or
        catching a cold or another respiratory infection. Childhood asthma can
        cause bothersome daily symptoms that interfere with play, sports,
        school, and sleep. In some children, unmanaged asthma can cause
        dangerous asthma attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Childhood asthma isn't a different disease from asthma in adults, but
        children do face unique challenges. Asthma in children is a leading
        cause of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and missed
        school days. Unfortunately, childhood asthma can't be cured, and
        symptoms may continue into adulthood. But with the right treatment, you
        and your child can keep symptoms under control and prevent damage to
        growing lungs.
      </p>

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>
      <p>Common childhood asthma signs and symptoms include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Frequent, intermittent coughing</li>
        <li>A whistling or wheezing sound when exhaling</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath</li>
        <li>Chest congestion or tightness</li>
        <li>Chest pain, particularly in younger children</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Other signs and symptoms of childhood asthma include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Trouble sleeping caused by shortness of breath, coughing, or wheezing
        </li>
        <li>
          Bouts of coughing or wheezing that get worse with a respiratory
          infection, such as a cold or the flu
        </li>
        <li>Delayed recovery or bronchitis after a respiratory infection</li>
        <li>Trouble breathing that may limit play or exercise</li>
        <li>Fatigue, which can be caused by poor sleep</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The first signs of asthma in young children may be recurrent wheezing
        triggered by a respiratory virus. As children grow older, asthma
        associated with respiratory allergies is more common.
      </p>
      <p>
        Asthma signs and symptoms vary from child to child, and may get worse or
        better over time. Your child may have only one sign or symptom, such as
        a lingering cough or chest congestion.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may be difficult to tell whether your child's symptoms are caused by
        asthma or something else. Periodic or long-lasting wheezing and other
        asthma-like symptoms may be caused by infectious bronchitis or another
        respiratory problem.
      </p>

      <h2>When to see a doctor</h2>
      <p>
        Take your child to see the doctor as soon as possible if you suspect he
        or she may have asthma. Early treatment will not only help control
        day-to-day asthma symptoms, but also may prevent asthma attacks.
      </p>
      <p>Make an appointment with your child's doctor if you notice:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Coughing that's constant, intermittent, or seems to be linked to
          physical activity
        </li>
        <li>Wheezing or whistling sounds when your child exhales</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath or rapid breathing</li>
        <li>Complaints of chest tightness</li>
        <li>Repeated episodes of suspected bronchitis or pneumonia</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If your child has asthma, he or she may say such things as, "My chest
        feels funny" or "I'm always coughing." Listen for bouts of coughing when
        your child is asleep. This coughing may or may not awaken your child.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crying, laughing, yelling, or strong emotional reactions and stress also
        may trigger coughing or wheezing.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your child is diagnosed with asthma, creating an asthma action plan
        can help you and other caregivers monitor symptoms and know what to do
        if an asthma attack does occur.
      </p>

      <h2>Causes</h2>
      <p>
        The underlying causes of childhood asthma aren't fully understood.
        Developing an overly sensitive immune system generally plays a role.
        Some factors thought to be involved include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Inherited traits</li>
        <li>Some types of airway infections at a very young age</li>
        <li>
          Exposure to environmental factors, such as cigarette smoke or other
          air pollution
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Increased immune system sensitivity causes the lungs and airways to
        swell and produce mucus when exposed to certain triggers. Reaction to a
        trigger may be delayed, making it more difficult to identify the
        trigger. These triggers vary from child to child and can include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Viral infections such as the common cold</li>
        <li>Exposure to air pollutants, such as tobacco smoke</li>
        <li>Allergies to dust mites, pet dander, pollen, or mold</li>
        <li>Physical activity</li>
        <li>Weather changes or cold air</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sometimes, asthma symptoms occur with no apparent triggers.</p>

      <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
      <p>
        Factors that may increase your child's likelihood of developing asthma
        include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Exposure to tobacco smoke</li>
        <li>
          Previous allergic reactions, including skin reactions, food allergies,
          or hay fever (allergic rhinitis)
        </li>
        <li>A family history of asthma, allergic rhinitis, hives, or eczema</li>
        <li>
          Living in an urban area with increased exposure to air pollution
        </li>
        <li>Obesity</li>
        <li>
          Respiratory conditions, such as a chronic runny or stuffy nose
          (rhinitis), inflamed sinuses (sinusitis), or pneumonia
        </li>
        <li>Heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD)</li>
        <li>Being male</li>
        <li>Being black</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Complications</h2>
      <p>Asthma may cause a number of complications, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Severe asthma attacks that require emergency treatment or hospital
          care
        </li>
        <li>Permanent narrowing of the airways (bronchial tubes)</li>
        <li>Missed school days or getting behind in school</li>
        <li>Poor sleep and fatigue</li>
        <li>Symptoms that interfere with play, sports, or other activities</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Prevention</h2>
      <p>
        Careful planning and steering clear of asthma triggers are the best ways
        to prevent asthma attacks.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Limit exposure to asthma triggers:</b> Be proactive in helping your
          child avoid the allergens and irritants that trigger asthma symptoms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Don't allow smoking around your child:</b> Exposure to tobacco
          smoke during infancy is a strong risk factor for childhood asthma, as
          well as a common trigger of asthma attacks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Encourage your child to be active:</b> As long as your child's
          asthma is well-controlled, regular physical activity can condition the
          lungs to work more efficiently.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>See the doctor when necessary:</b> Check in on a regular basis.
          Don't ignore signs that your child's asthma may not be under control,
          such as needing to use a quick-relief inhaler too often.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Help your child maintain a healthy weight:</b> Being overweight can
          worsen asthma symptoms and put your child at risk of other health
          problems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Keep heartburn under control:</b> Acid reflux or severe heartburn
          (GERD) may worsen your child's asthma symptoms. He or she may need
          over-the-counter or prescription medications to control acid reflux.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
      <p>
        Asthma can be hard to diagnose. Your child's doctor will consider the
        nature and frequency of symptoms and may use tests to rule out other
        conditions and to identify the most likely cause of his or her symptoms.
      </p>
      <p>
        A number of childhood conditions can have symptoms similar to those
        caused by asthma. To make things more complicated, these conditions also
        commonly co-occur with asthma. So your child's doctor will have to
        determine whether your child's symptoms are caused by asthma, a
        condition other than asthma, or both asthma and another condition.
      </p>

      <p>Some conditions that can cause asthma-like symptoms include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rhinitis</li>
        <li>Sinusitis</li>
        <li>Acid reflux or GERD</li>
        <li>Airway abnormalities</li>
        <li>Vocal cord dysfunction</li>
        <li>Respiratory tract infections such as bronchiolitis and RSV</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The doctor will ask for a detailed description of your child's symptoms
        and health. Your child may also need medical tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>In children 5 years of age and older,</b> doctors diagnose asthma
        with the same tests used to identify the disease in adults. Lung
        function tests (spirometry) measure how quickly and how much air your
        child can exhale. Your child may have lung function tests during regular
        checkups to monitor how well controlled the asthma is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your child may have lung function tests at rest, after exercising and
        after taking asthma medication.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>In younger children,</b> diagnosis can be difficult because lung
        function tests aren't accurate before 5 years of age. Your doctor will
        rely on detailed information you and your child provide about symptoms.
        Sometimes a diagnosis can't be made until later, after months or even
        years of observing symptoms.
      </p>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of asthma treatment is to keep symptoms under control all of
        the time. Well-controlled asthma means that your child has:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Minimal or no symptoms</li>
        <li>Few or no asthma flare-ups</li>
        <li>No limitations on physical activities or exercise</li>
        <li>Minimal use of quick-relief (rescue) inhalers</li>
        <li>Few or no side effects from medications</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Treating asthma involves both preventing symptoms and treating an asthma
        attack in progress. The right medication for your child depends on a
        number of things, including his or her age, symptoms, asthma triggers,
        and what seems to work best to keep his or her asthma under control.
      </p>

      <h2>Long-term control medications</h2>
      <p>
        Preventive, long-term control medications reduce the inflammation in
        your child's airways that leads to symptoms. In most cases, these
        medications need to be taken every day.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Inhaled corticosteroids:</b> These medications include fluticasone
          (Flovent Diskus, Flovent HFA), budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler),
          mometasone (Asmanex), ciclesonide (Alvesco), beclomethasone (Qvar),
          and others.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Leukotriene modifiers:</b> These oral medications include
          montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate), and zileuton (Zyflo).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Combination inhalers:</b> These medications contain an inhaled
          corticosteroid plus a long-acting beta agonist (LABA).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Theophylline:</b> This is a daily pill that helps keep the airways
          open.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Quick-relief medications</h2>
      <p>
        Quick-relief medications quickly open swollen airways that are limiting
        breathing. Also called rescue medications, quick-relief medications are
        used as needed for rapid, short-term symptom relief during an asthma
        attack or before exercise if your child's doctor recommends it.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Short-acting beta agonists:</b> These inhaled bronchodilator
          medications can rapidly ease symptoms during an asthma attack. They
          include albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA) and levalbuterol (Xopenex
          HFA).
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Ipratropium (Atrovent HFA):</b> Your doctor might prescribe this
          inhaled medication for immediate relief of your child's symptoms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Oral and intravenous corticosteroids:</b> These medications relieve
          airway inflammation caused by severe asthma.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Treatment for allergy-induced asthma</h2>
      <p>
        If your child's asthma is triggered or worsened by allergies, your child
        may benefit from allergy treatment as well.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Omalizumab (Xolair):</b> This medication reduces the immune
          system's reaction to allergy-causing substances.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Allergy medications:</b> These include oral and nasal spray
          antihistamines and decongestants as well as corticosteroid, cromolyn,
          and ipratropium nasal sprays.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Allergy shots (immunotherapy):</b> Immunotherapy injections
          gradually reduce your child's immune system reaction to specific
          allergens.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Inhaled medication devices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Older children and teens</b> may use a small, hand-held device
          called a pressurized metered dose inhaler or an inhaler that releases
          a fine powder.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Infants and toddlers</b> need to use a face mask attached to a
          metered dose inhaler or a nebulizer to get the correct dose of
          medication.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Babies</b> need to use a device called a nebulizer, a machine that
          turns liquid medication into fine droplets.
        </li>
      </ul>
