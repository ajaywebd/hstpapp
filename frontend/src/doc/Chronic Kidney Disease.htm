      <h1>Chronic Kidney Disease</h1>

      <p>
        Chronic kidney disease means your child’s kidneys do not function as
        well as they should. For example, the kidneys may not filter the blood
        properly to flush waste from the body, and as a result, the waste builds
        up until your child becomes sick. At the Pediatric Chronic Kidney
        Disease Clinic at C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital, our goal is to slow
        down or stop the kidney damage. Our multidisciplinary team of
        specialists provides comprehensive and compassionate care, along with
        access to the latest treatments and clinical trials.
      </p>

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>More frequent urination, especially at night</li>
        <li>Feeling tired and having less energy</li>
        <li>Trouble sleeping</li>
        <li>Nausea</li>
        <li>Headaches</li>
        <li>Weight loss and/or loss of appetite</li>
        <li>
          Swelling in feet, ankles, or around the eyes due to fluid buildup
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        There are five stages of chronic kidney disease, determined by the rate
        that the kidneys filter blood (called the glomerular filtration rate,
        GFR), with Stage 1 being the mildest level of kidney damage and Stage 5
        indicating kidney failure. Diagnosis of chronic kidney disease and GFR
        is made using urine and blood tests, and possibly specialized tests
        performed by a radiologist. Treatment varies depending on your child’s
        stage.
      </p>

      <p>
        Chronic kidney disease can be caused by a disease specific to the
        kidney, or it can result from another medical issue, such as diabetes or
        high blood pressure, which affects the entire body. Part of your child’s
        evaluation will include looking for the cause of the kidney damage. If
        it is due to another condition, treatment for that issue will be
        provided.
      </p>

      <h2>Causes</h2>
      <p>
        The causes of chronic kidney disease are very different in children than
        in adults.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>In infants and children:</b> Birth defects, congenital
          abnormalities, and hereditary diseases, like polycystic kidney
          disease, are the most common causes of chronic kidney disease.
          Frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children should be
          promptly treated and further evaluated, as urinary tract abnormalities
          could potentially lead to CKD.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>In teenagers:</b> In children over the age of 12,
          glomerulonephritis (inflammation of the kidneys) is the most frequent
          cause of kidney failure. Other conditions that may damage the kidneys,
          like nephrotic syndrome, or diseases that affect many organs, like
          lupus, are also common causes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>In adults:</b> CKD (Chronic kidney disease) is mainly caused by
          diabetes and high blood pressure. In contrast to adults, high blood
          pressure does not usually cause kidney failure in children, but often
          is caused by renal failure. However, it is important to note that many
          of the risk factors for CKD, such as obesity leading to type 2
          diabetes, start in childhood and may contribute to progressive kidney
          disease in adulthood.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
      <p>
        CKD (Chronic kidney disease) is diagnosed in many ways. Some kidney
        problems are found before birth by ultrasound. Sometimes, children are
        diagnosed with other conditions where kidney problems are known to be
        more common. Usually, there are other concerns about a child's health
        that lead to a diagnosis of CKD.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Urinalysis:</b> A child's urine will be collected to check for
          protein. Protein in the urine may be a sign of kidney damage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Blood tests:</b> Blood tests can help show many things, including
          kidney function level, blood chemical levels, and red blood cell
          levels, all of which the kidneys help to control. Sometimes, there are
          also specialized blood tests that may help diagnose specific kidney
          diseases such as lupus.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Ultrasound and X-rays:</b> Pictures of the kidneys help show any
          damage to the kidney and surrounding structures. They may also give
          hints about what caused the kidney problem.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Kidney biopsy:</b> A small piece of kidney tissue is taken out and
          examined under a microscope to determine the cause and extent of
          damage to the kidneys.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>
      <p>
        Treatment begins with dietary changes and medicines. Your child may need
        to take several medicines, including vitamins, calcium, bicarbonate, and
        blood pressure pills. Medication management can be a major challenge.
      </p>

      <p>
        If your child has trouble remembering to take medicines, consider
        getting a medicine clock, which has two cardboard clocks — one for each
        12-hour period — with a picture of the medicines posted on the times
        they need to be taken. These clocks can provide valuable cues for kids
        who need to take several doses of different medicines throughout the day
        and evening. Also, alarms can be set to remind kids to take their
        medicine.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your child must take so much medicine that it affects his or her
        appetite, call your doctor for advice. Try to find the most acceptable
        forms of medicine (smaller pills, capsules, or more concentrated
        liquids, for example) and simplify the schedule under your doctor's
        guidance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Injectable medicines are available for treatment of anemia and growth
        failure in some kids with chronic kidney disease. Erythropoetin can
        increase the red blood cell count, which often improves energy and
        activity levels in kids with kidney failure. Many kids with chronic
        kidney disease will grow more normally with the help of human growth
        hormone injections.
      </p>
      <p>
        Children with chronic kidney failure may not have any symptoms until
        about 80% of their kidney function is lost. Then, they may feel Tired,
        have nausea or vomiting, have difficulty concentrating, or feel
        confused. Fluid build-up appears as swelling in the skin, fluid
        congestion in the lungs, and high blood pressure. At this stage, two
        treatment options are available — dialysis and transplant.
      </p>
      <h3>Dialysis</h3>
      <p>
        Nearly all kids with end-stage kidney disease eventually receive
        transplants. If a living related donor can't be found, dialysis may be
        required until a donor kidney becomes available.
      </p>

      <p>
        The two forms of dialysis are <b>hemodialysis</b> and
        <b>peritoneal dialysis</b>:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Hemodialysis:</b> In this treatment, blood is cleansed outside the
          body through a machine. These treatments take several hours at a time
          and usually need to be done three or more times a week. In most cases,
          hemodialysis is done in a dialysis center, but in some cases, it can
          be done at home.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Peritoneal dialysis:</b>
          This treatment uses the body's own peritoneal membrane — beneath the
          outer layers of the abdominal wall — to filter the blood. Two forms of
          peritoneal dialysis are available: continuous cycling peritoneal
          dialysis (CCPD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD).
          CCPD uses a simple machine called a cycler to perform the dialysis at
          night; CAPD is done throughout the day and no machine is needed. CCPD
          requires the assistance of a parent and is most suitable for younger
          children; CAPD is performed by the patient and may be more suitable
          for older kids and teens.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Helping Your Child</h2>
      <p>
        Kids with chronic kidney disease often need dietary changes. Making sure
        that they get enough calories and nutrients can be a challenge.
        Supplementing your child's diet with extra carbohydrates and fats might
        help to increase calorie intake.
      </p>

      <p>
        The kidneys cannot easily remove excess water, salt, or potassium, so
        their intake might need to be limited. Dairy products have to be
        restricted because they contain lots of phosphorus. Too much phosphorus
        may lead to calcium deposits in the eyes, heart, skin, and joints, which
        can increase the risk of broken bones.
      </p>

      <p>
        Exercise will help your child sweat, which will get rid of excess fluid
        and flush out toxins through the skin. Encouraging physical activity,
        such as walking and strength training, will help their bones grow
        stronger and improve their overall health.
      </p>
      <h2>Sodium</h2>
      <p>
        Some kids with kidney disease, particularly those with high blood
        pressure, may need to restrict their intake of sodium, which is found in
        table salt and many foods. Be careful of salt substitutes, too. Many
        have potassium in them, which can cause problems for kids with kidney
        failure. Some other salt preparations (for example, "natural salts,"
        Himalayan salts, etc.) are just as high in sodium chloride as common
        table salt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Read food labels and talk to your doctor or a dietitian about the sodium
        content of various foods. Consult your nephrologist about an appropriate
        diet that meets your child's need for calories and nutrients while
        minimizing damage to kidneys and avoiding other complications.
      </p>
      <h2>Exercise</h2>
      <p>
        Exercise will help your child sweat, which will get rid of excess fluid
        and flush out toxins through the skin. Keep TV and video games to a
        minimum and encourage physical activity instead. Walking and strength
        training make bones stronger and stimulate muscles and nerves that can
        help ease "restless leg syndrome" and other nervous system problems
        sometimes associated with kidney disease.
      </p>
      <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
      <p>
        As kids with chronic kidney diseases get older, they can take on more
        responsibility for their own care. School-age kids should know the names
        of their medicines and how and when they're taken. As they're making the
        transition to adulthood, teens can share in the responsibility of making
        appointments. Teens should also have time alone to speak with the doctor
        and other members of the health care team.
      </p>

      <p>
        A big step for kids is being able to talk to others — such as teachers,
        coaches, and friends — about their condition. Teens especially don't
        want to stand out or seem different. Part of the process of learning and
        maturing will be identifying limitations and knowing when to ask for
        help.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kids with chronic kidney disease might also have problems dealing with
        the side effects of medicines. For those taking prednisone for long
        periods of time, these effects can be significant, including weight gain
        (especially around the face and trunk), moodiness, sleep disturbances,
        cataracts, and osteoporosis (weakening of the bones). Long-term
        treatment with these medicines also can slow growth and delay pubertal
        maturation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long-term prednisone treatment can cause acne (or make it worse) in
        teens. To an adolescent dealing with body image, a clear complexion
        might be just as important as controlling the kidney disease.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides the stress of having a chronic illness, your child is going
        through the trials of growing up, just like other kids. Treat him or her
        as a child first, which includes setting rules about behavior.
        Sometimes, those standards can be relaxed during particularly difficult
        times; the trick is picking them up again after your child's health
        improves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep the lines of communication open so everyone knows what's happening
        and never hesitate to ask for help from your doctor or a mental health
        professional if you think it might be needed.
