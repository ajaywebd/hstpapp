      <h1><b>Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate</b></h1>

      <p>
        Cleft lip and cleft palate are birth abnormalities of the mouth and lip.
        In the United States, nearly 6,800 babies are born with oral clefts
        annually. These abnormalities occur less frequently among
        African-Americans. Cleft lip and cleft palate occur early in pregnancy
        when the sides of the lip and the roof of the mouth do not fuse together
        as they should. A child can have cleft lip, cleft palate, or both. Cleft
        lip and cleft palate together are more common in boys. It is also
        important to know that most babies born with a cleft are otherwise
        healthy with no other birth abnormalities.
      </p>

      <p><b>Cleft palate</b></p>

      <p>
        Cleft palate occurs when the roof of the mouth does not completely
        close, leaving an opening that can extend into the nasal cavity. The
        cleft may involve either side of the palate. It can extend from the
        front of the mouth (hard palate) to the throat (soft palate). Often the
        cleft will also include the lip. Cleft palate is not as noticeable as
        cleft lip because it is inside the mouth. It may be the only abnormality
        in the child, or it may be associated with cleft lip or other syndromes.
        In many cases, other family members have also had a cleft palate at
        birth.
      </p>

      <p><b>Cleft lip</b></p>

      <p>
        Cleft lip is an abnormality in which the lip does not completely form
        during fetal development. The degree of the cleft lip can vary greatly,
        from mild (notching of the lip) to severe (large opening from the lip up
        through the nose). As a parent, it may be stressful to adjust to the
        obvious abnormality of the face, as it can be very noticeable.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are different names given to the cleft lip according to its
        location and how much of the lip is involved. A cleft on one side of the
        lip that does not extend into the nose is called unilateral incomplete.
        A cleft on one side of the lip that extends into the nose is called
        unilateral complete. A cleft that involves both sides of the lip and
        extends into and involves the nose is called bilateral complete.
      </p>

      <p><b>Causes of cleft lip and cleft palate</b></p>

      <p>
        The exact cause of cleft lip and cleft palate is not completely
        understood. Cleft lip and/or cleft palate are caused by multiple genes
        inherited from both parents, as well as environmental factors that
        scientists do not yet fully understand. When a combination of genes and
        environmental factors cause a condition, the inheritance is called
        "multifactorial" (many factors contribute to the cause). Because genes
        are involved, the chance for a cleft lip and/or cleft palate to happen
        again in a family is increased, depending on how many people in the
        family have a cleft lip and/or cleft palate. If parents without clefts
        have a baby with a cleft, the chance for them to have another baby with
        a cleft ranges from 3% to 5%. If a parent has a cleft, but no children
        have a cleft, the chance to have a baby with a cleft is 5 percent. If a
        parent and a child have a cleft, the chance is even greater for a future
        child to be born with a cleft. Genetic consultation is suggested.
      </p>

      <p><b>Complications</b></p>

      <p>
        Beyond the cosmetic abnormality, there are other possible complications
        that may be associated with cleft lip and cleft palate, including the
        following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Feeding difficulties:</b> Feeding difficulties occur more with
          cleft palate abnormalities. The infant may be unable to suck properly
          because the roof of the mouth is not formed completely.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Ear infections and hearing loss:</b> Ear infections are often due
          to a dysfunction of the tube that connects the middle ear and the
          throat. Recurrent infections can then lead to hearing loss.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Speech and language delay:</b> Due to the opening of the roof of
          the mouth and the lip, muscle function may be decreased, which can
          lead to a delay in speech or abnormal speech. Referral to a speech
          therapist should be discussed with your child's doctor.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Dental problems:</b> As a result of the abnormalities, teeth may
          not erupt normally and orthodontic treatment is usually required.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Feeding my baby with cleft palate</b></p>

      <p>
        The most immediate concern for a baby with cleft palate is good
        nutrition. Sucking for children with a cleft palate is difficult because
        of the poorly formed roof of the mouth. Children with just a cleft lip
        (without a cleft palate) do not routinely have feeding difficulties. The
        following are suggestions to help aid in the feeding of your infant:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Breastfeeding may take extra time and patience:</b> Be open to
          alternatives if this is not providing adequate nutrition for your
          infant. You may still pump your breast and feed your infant breast
          milk through other techniques.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hold your infant in an upright position to help keep the food from
          coming out of the nose.
        </li>
        <li>
          Other feeding devices may be utilized. Consult with your child's
          doctor for more information.
        </li>
        <li>
          Small, frequent feedings are recommended. This can be a frustrating
          and slow process; however, your infant will receive more calories, and
          therefore, gain weight.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are many types of bottles and nipples on the market that can
          assist with feeding an infant with cleft palate. Consult with your
          child's doctor regarding which type is most appropriate for your
          child. The following are a few examples:
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Dr. Brown's Specialty Feeding System:</b> This is a unique bottle
          that has a unidirectional flow valve designed specifically to assist
          in the management and treatment of complicated oral feeding issues.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cleft palate nurser by Mead Johnson:</b> This is a soft, plastic
          bottle that is easy to squeeze and has a large crosscut nipple. You
          may use any nipple that the infant prefers with this system.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b
            >Special needs bottle by Medela (also known as the Haberman
            Feeder):</b
          >
          This is a specially designed bottle system with a valve to help
          control the air the baby drinks and to prevent milk from going back
          into the bottle.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Treatment for cleft lip and cleft palate</b></p>

      <p>
        Cleft lip and/or palate is typically corrected with surgery, but each
        child may require a variety of services including dental/orthodontic
        care before surgery. The Cleft and Craniofacial team will work with you,
        your child, and your pediatrician to determine the best treatment plan
        for your child. Treatment options include:
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Surgery for Cleft Lip:</b> For most infants with cleft lip, the
        abnormality can be repaired within the first several months of life
        (usually between 3 and 6 months of age). The goal of this surgery is to
        fix the separation of the lip.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Surgery for Cleft Palate:</b> Cleft palate repairs are usually done
        between the ages of 10 to 12 months. The goal of this surgery is to fix
        the roof of the mouth so that your child can eat and learn to talk
        normally.
      </p>

      <p><b>Living With Cleft Lip or Cleft Palate</b></p>

      <p>
        Some kids with severe cleft lip or cleft palate have a flattened nose or
        small jaw. Other kids with just cleft palate may look just like everyone
        else.
      </p>

      <p>
        Either way, kids with cleft lip or cleft palate want to be treated like
        everyone else. A person might have cleft lip, but also have beautiful
        eyes, a great sense of humor, or a terrific slam-dunk!
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have cleft lip or cleft palate, there may be some things about
        your face you can't change and some that you can. Doctors can do amazing
        things to make you feel good about the way you look on the outside, and
        you can do things to make yourself feel good about the way you are on
        the inside.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even with the many successful operations and treatment for cleft lip and
        palate, some kids have a hard time growing up with this condition. They
        may have classmates who tease or bully them or who are just curious and
        want to know more about it.
      </p>

      <p>
        In either case, kids with clefts can get help handling these situations
        by speaking with their parents, teachers, or counselors, and of course,
        any member of their cleft palate team. The good news is that kids with
        cleft lip or cleft palate can and do grow up to be healthy, happy
        adults!
