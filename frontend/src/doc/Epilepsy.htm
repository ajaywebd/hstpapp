      <h1>Epilepsy</h1>

      <p>
        Epilepsy comes from a Greek word meaning "to hold or seize," and people
        who have epilepsy have seizures. You might also hear a seizure called a
        convulsion, fit, or spell.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your brain cells are constantly sending out electrical signals that
        travel along nerves to the rest of the body. These signals tell the
        muscles to move so you can do your normal activities. During a seizure,
        a person's muscles tighten and relax rapidly or stop moving completely.
        Seizures come on suddenly, and people who have them cannot control their
        muscles while they are having a seizure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Depending on where in the brain a seizure is happening, a person's
        behavior may change in different ways. If too many brain cells are
        sending signals at the same time, it causes an overload, and a person
        may pass out and shake all over. People who have epilepsy may have
        seizures only once in a while or as frequently as every day.
      </p>

      <h2>What's a Seizure?</h2>

      <p>
        A seizure is a change in a person’s behavior that comes from abnormal
        electrical activity in the brain. Most seizures occur without warning,
        although some people have a funny feeling, an upset stomach, or a weird
        smell or taste right before a seizure. This is called an aura. Others
        find that certain things may bring on a seizure, like not getting enough
        sleep or playing video games.
      </p>

      <p>
        During a seizure, the person may fall down, shake, stiffen, throw up,
        drool, urinate (pee), or lose bowel control. Other seizures seem less
        dramatic. Someone might just stare into space or have jerking movements
        in one part of the body. When the seizure is over, the person may feel
        sleepy and won’t remember what happened.
      </p>

      <h2>Who has epilepsy?</h2>

      <p>
        About 3 million Americans have epilepsy, including boys and girls and
        people of all races and ages. Seizures can start at any age, but often
        they begin before age 10 or after age 55.
      </p>

      <p>
        Doctors often can’t explain why a person has epilepsy. They do know that
        epilepsy is not contagious — you can’t catch it from somebody. Epilepsy
        is not passed down through families (inherited) in the same way that
        blue eyes or brown hair are. But if somebody’s mom or dad or sibling has
        epilepsy, then he or she has a slightly higher risk for epilepsy than
        somebody whose family has no history of seizures.
      </p>

      <h2>Causes of epilepsy</h2>

      <p>
        Some children develop epilepsy as a result of brain injury, which could
        be due to a severe head injury, complications during birth, or
        infections like meningitis that affect the brain. Epilepsy caused by
        such structural changes is called symptomatic epilepsy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Researchers also believe that the development of epilepsy is often
        linked to genetics. A person's genetic tendency combined with factors
        like brain injury can contribute to the onset of epilepsy, though not
        everyone with similar injuries develops epilepsy.
      </p>

      <h2>Symptoms</h2>

      <p>Common symptoms of seizures include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Staring and unresponsiveness</li>
        <li>Confusion</li>
        <li>Jerks and twitches</li>
        <li>Wandering</li>
        <li>Shaking or falling</li>
        <li>Picking or lip-smacking</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>First aid for seizures</h2>

      <h3>For non-convulsive seizures:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Watch the person carefully to recognize the seizure</li>
        <li>Speak quietly and calmly</li>
        <li>Explain to others what is happening</li>
        <li>Guide the person to a safe area</li>
        <li>Don't restrain or stop movements</li>
        <li>Stay with the person until full consciousness is regained</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>For convulsive (grand mal) seizures:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Time the seizure</li>
        <li>Look for medical identification, such as a seizure bracelet</li>
        <li>Turn the person on their side, away from dangerous objects</li>
        <li>Do not put anything in the person's mouth</li>
        <li>Remove tight clothing or objects around the neck</li>
        <li>Call 9-1-1 if the seizure lasts more than five minutes</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>

      <p>
        A complete physical and neurological examination is conducted to
        understand the cause of seizures. An Electroencephalogram (EEG) records
        electrical activity in the brain and provides insights into the location
        and type of epileptic discharges.
      </p>

      <p>Additional tests may include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Brain imaging studies such as MRI, PET, or SPECT</li>
        <li>
          Neuropsychological testing to assess cognitive functions affected by
          epilepsy
        </li>
        <li>Blood and urine tests to rule out other underlying conditions</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Treatment</h2>

      <p>
        The general practitioner (GP) will often refer a child with epilepsy to
        a pediatrician or pediatric neurologist for further care. From around
        age 16, care may be transferred to an adult neurologist.
      </p>

      <h3>Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs)</h3>

      <p>
        Most people with epilepsy are treated with AEDs, which aim to prevent
        seizures but cannot stop seizures that are already occurring. AEDs are
        generally effective but may cause side effects.
      </p>

      <h3>Other treatments</h3>

      <p>
        If AEDs do not control seizures, other treatments may be considered:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Ketogenic diet:</strong> A high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet
          that may reduce seizures in children with medication-resistant
          epilepsy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Epilepsy surgery:</strong> Surgery may be an option for some
          children, depending on the type of epilepsy and the part of the brain
          affected.
        </li>
      </ul>
