      <h1><b>Cardiomyopathy</b></h1>

      <p>
        Cardiomyopathy is any disease of the heart muscle in which the heart
        loses its ability to pump blood effectively. In some instances, heart
        rhythm is disturbed, leading to irregular heartbeats, or arrhythmias.
        There may be multiple causes of cardiomyopathy, including viral
        infections. Sometimes, the exact cause of the muscle disease is never
        found.
      </p>

      <p><b>How does cardiomyopathy differ from other heart disorders?</b></p>

      <p>
        Cardiomyopathy differs from many of the other disorders of the heart in
        several ways, including the following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Cardiomyopathy can, and often does, occur in children.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The condition is fairly uncommon, affecting only about 50,000 Americans
        (adults and children).<br />
        Cardiomyopathy is a leading cause for heart transplantation.<br />
        The condition tends to be progressive and sometimes worsens fairly
        quickly.<br />
        It may be associated with diseases involving other organs, as well as
        the heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cardiomyopathy prevents the heart muscle from pumping enough blood to
        meet the body's needs.
      </p>

      <p><b>5 forms of cardiomyopathy</b></p>

      <ul>
        <li>Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)</li>
        <li>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)</li>
        <li>Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM)</li>
        <li>Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARCM)</li>
        <li>Left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Who gets cardiomyopathy?</b></p>

      <p>
        Cardiomyopathy predominantly affects adults, but in rare instances, it
        affects infants and children. According to the North American Pediatric
        Cardiomyopathy Registry, one out of 100,000 children in the U.S. is
        diagnosed with cardiomyopathy each year. However, this is a conservative
        number because it does not include all types of cardiomyopathies.
        Cardiomyopathy can occur in any child regardless of age, gender, race,
        or economic background.
      </p>

      <p><b>Causes</b></p>

      <p>
        There are many causes of cardiomyopathy in children, including some that
        are not fully understood. Common causes include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Inheriting the condition from one or both parents</li>
        <li>A viral infection</li>
        <li>Toxins affecting other organs</li>
        <li>Using chemotherapy drugs</li>
        <li>
          Metabolic, mitochondrial, or systemic diseases in parts of the body
          other than the heart
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Despite advances in genetic testing, the exact cause remains unknown in
        2/3 diagnosed children.
      </p>

      <p><b>Symptoms</b></p>

      <p>
        Occasionally, symptoms of pediatric cardiomyopathy can be mistaken as a
        cold, flu, asthma, or stomachache. Some affected children have no
        symptoms, while others may experience any of the following symptoms:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Shortness of breath or rapid breathing</li>
        <li>Dizziness and fainting</li>
        <li>Irregular or rapid heartbeat</li>
        <li>Abdominal bloating or swelling</li>
        <li>Chest pain</li>
        <li>Extreme fatigue</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Infants may experience poor weight gain, extreme sleepiness, difficulty
        feeding, or excessive sweating.
      </p>

      <p><b>Diagnosis</b></p>

      <p>
        A pediatric cardiologist confirms the diagnosis through an
        echocardiogram (echo) and electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG). In some cases,
        other medical tests are necessary. Genetic testing may be recommended to
        verify the cause of the disease.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since pediatric cardiomyopathy is rare, it is recommended to locate a
        children's medical center with a wide range of experience in managing
        children with cardiomyopathy. Early diagnosis and treatment of the
        disease are essential to preventing complications and progression to
        heart failure.
      </p>

      <p><b>Treatment</b></p>

      <p>
        Specific treatment for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy will be determined by
        your child’s physician based on:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Your child’s age, overall health, and medical history</li>
        <li>Extent of the disease</li>
        <li>
          Your child’s tolerance for specific medications, procedures, or
          therapies
        </li>
        <li>Expectations for the course of the disease</li>
        <li>Your opinion or preference</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Your child’s physician may recommend medications to accomplish the
        following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Decrease the workload of the heart</li>
        <li>Decrease the oxygen requirements of the heart</li>
        <li>Regulate irregular heartbeats</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Surgical treatment may include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Removal of part of the enlarged muscle</li>
        <li>Artificial pacemaker</li>
        <li>Heart transplantation</li>
      </ul>
